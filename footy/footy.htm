          It's going to take some fancy footwork to solve these football themed logic-puzzles. 
          Coordinate your team-mates to strike a perfect goal, but also take care not to lose the
          ball in the long grass! Can you solve every puzzle before the final whistle?

        Coordinate your team players (blue) to kick the red ball (red square) into the net. 
        The active player is marked with a white dot and he can move around freely in order to
        kick any available ball in any direction. 
        Kicking the ball to a different player will transfer active control to the new player. 
        Later puzzles feature opponent players (grey) that don't move and never become active 
        but will kick a passing ball. This may or may not be helpful!
