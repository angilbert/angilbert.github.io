1 swamp (peg board)
40 puzzle overlays              
20 tree-stumps (pegs)
2 short planks
2 medium planks
1 long plank

The object ------------------------------------------------------

The object of the puzzle is to find a route across an alligator 
infested swamp. Lucky for you there are several tree stumps in
the swamp, and a few old planks. Perhaps if you could reach 
those planks and move them one at a time to bridge tree-stump
to tree-stump you could find a route home. But beware... 
one false step and those 'gators will eat you for breakfast! 
So take it steady, don't jump, never carry more than one plank, 
and make sure every plank is always firmly placed between two 
tree-stumps.

How to play -----------------------------------------------------

Empty the peg board of all playing pieces and place your next
puzzle overlay onto the board. Place a stump peg into each
visible hole, and place a plank onto each plank start position 
(marked in grey). Each plank should be a snug fit, between two 
stumps. Each puzzle requires 2, 3, 4 or 5 planks.

You are now ready to play. Place a finger on the start stump 
(marked with a little man) and 'walk' the first plank by running
your finger along to the far tree-stump. So far so good, but now 
what? Well, if there's another plank you could walk that too, or 
if not, then you are going to have to stand on the current tree-
stump, pick up that first plank and put it down in a different 
direction. If you have a choice, it's up to you. You can also 
pick up a plank and walk with it as far as you wish along other 
planks before putting it down again. Just remember however, if 
you can't reach a plank you can't pick it up, and there's no 
point trying to move a plank if there's no other gap of the 
right size to put it down.

Note, if you have to put the board down mid-challenge be sure 
to mark your current location so you know which planks you can 
reach.

The full rules --------------------------------------------------

- You can pick up and carry a plank provided you have access to 
  one end. 
- You can only pick-up and carry one plank at a time. 
- You cannot move a plank if you are already carrying one. 
- Planks must be supported both ends, and must be an exact fit. 
- You cannot jump between stumps or planks. 
- Planks cannot be used diagonally, only north-south or east-west. 
- Planks cannot support other planks, and cannot be stacked. 
- Planks cannot bridge intermediate stumps or planks.
