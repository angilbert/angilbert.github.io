        <h2>Tile puzzles</h2>
        <p>
          The tile puzzles are tiny, elegant, jigsaw-esque puzzles, that 
          completely defy their innocent appearance.
          Each puzzle consists of a small number (typically less than 12) monomino 
          and domino tiles each depicting a network-like pathway terminating 
          in up to 6 edge connectors.
          The challenge is to arrange the tiles so that the pathways all join up 
          to form a closed network. All the tiles must be used but the final 
          solution can be any shape.

          <p>The tile-puzzles have a long history.</p>
          <p>First conceived in 1981, a single 12-piece puzzle made its public 
            debut in the local village newsletter as a print-and-play puzzle. 
            A mass distribution that reached about 100 households.</p>

            In late 1997 the <a href="./all4.png">classic four</a> tile-puzzles
            were designed and launched right here at clickmazes, as interactive 
            puzzles in applet form. They were accessible right up until 2016 when 
            the last few browsers finally pulled the plug on applet support.</p>
          <p>
            The original applet can still be downloaded and run locally using the 
            appletviewer utility that continued to ship with the JRE a little
            while longer.
            My copy of appletviewer is build 1.8.0_91-b14 for MAC OS.

          <p>In 2002 we branched out and decided to construct several sets of physical 
            tile-puzzles using printed paper stuck onto MDF. The original four puzzles 
            from 1997, plus a small yellow puzzle.</p>
            <p>
            Twenty years later these puzzles are still in regular use and have 
            made outings to many national and international puzzle-gatherings.</p>

          <p>In 2020 the tile-puzzle applet briefly came back to life when the old 
            applet was successfully transpiled to HTML5 using cheerpj, to 
            accompany the relaunch of clickmazes. </p><p>
            To celebrate the event two new puzzles were put online called the 
            <a href="./new-duplex.htm">duplex-dilemma</a>, shown here on the 
            left. They differ only by the mirror-image of a single tile. Both 
            solutions unique and yet quite different.</p>

          <p>Over the years I've corresponded with several people who have written 
            tile-puzzle solvers. 
            The first would have been Graham Rogers circa 1990, then Timothy Bahls (2004) 
            and Matthieu Haller (2006). Plus one or two others that I have since lost 
            all record of.</p>
           <p>Timothy Bahls' solver was written as an applet with a visual UI, which made it
            my tool of choice. Over the years I refined and rewrote large chunks of it 
            to satisfy my occasional craving to explore more puzzle sets. </p>

          <p>In 2019 I set myself the challenge of finding a pack of core tiles 
            that could offer a variety of puzzles across the difficulty range.
            The goal was to maximise the number of uniquely 
            solve-able challenges while minimising the total number of tiles 
            in the pack.
          </p>
            <p>Three years later my efforts eventually resulted in a 
            pack of 15 tiles that offered at least 30 distinct puzzles. 
            The solution on the left is one of many solutions for all 15 tiles 
            (definitely not unique!).</p>
