        <h2>Extreme TJ-wriggle puzzles</h2><p>
          Welcome to extreme TJ-wriggle! The sample puzzles on this page are 
          a small taste of a large collection of new <a href="new-jwrig.htm">TJ-wriggle</a> 
          puzzles uncovered by Bob Henderson (USA) using automated computer search. 
          Bob has explored many grid sizes from 3x3 upwards, but the 4x4 grid turns 
          out to be the smallest grid where the results start to get exciting, with 
          puzzles exhibiting the depth and variety that we have come to expect from 
          the wriggle-rule.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Below is a collection of the very best of Bob's 4x4 results, the top-20 
        puzzles for one to four wrigglers giving a total of 80 puzzles to explore.
        I particularly recommend the <i>2-wriggler</i> &amp; <i>3-wriggler</i> sets. 
        Note that the puzzles in each set are in <i>descending</i> order of 
        solution-length, so the trickiest puzzles tend to be found at the the top 
        of each list, however there are plenty of surprises as you work down 
        each set. To read more about Bob's search engine see below. </p>
        <p>Please start by visiting the <a href="new-jwrig.htm">TJ-wriggle</a> page
        if not familiar with the rules.</p>

        <h4>Notes on Automated Wriggle Puzzle Generation (by 
        Bob Henderson)</h4>
          <p>About 30 years ago I entered an annual nationwide puzzle 
          competition in the USA. One of the challenges was to solve a simple sliding 
          block puzzle in the fewest possible moves. Having taken a few computer 
          programming classes and automated the solutions to various block-packing 
          puzzles, I felt sure that sliding-block puzzles would yield to a similar 
          approach. The method I used was a full-width search: finding first all 
          of the positions that could be reached in one move from the initial state, 
          then those that could be reached in two moves, etc. until the goal state 
          was found. It sped up the process considerably to store only the states 
          that had not already been reached, which was most easily handled by storing 
          the new states for each generation in their own file for comparison with 
          states found in later generations.</p>
        <p>As it happened, I won that competition, which led to a deepening 
          interest in slide puzzles. I read L. Edward Hordern's book 
          <a href="http://puzzlemuseum.com/library/SlidinPiecePz.htm">Sliding 
          Piece Puzzles</a>, corresponded with David Singmaster (who wrote its 
          foreword), visited 
          <a href="https://puzzleworld.org/SlidingBlockPuzzles/"> Nick 
          Baxter's Sliding Blocks site</a>, and provided Nick with several shorter 
          slide puzzle solutions. I collected the sliding block solver software 
          available over the Internet and even had Rik van Grol send me a floppy 
          disc with his own original program allowing human solvers to create and 
          solve slide puzzles on-screen.</p>
        <p>I soon became interested in creating as well as solving 
          such puzzles. The movement rules for most slide puzzles (as well as many 
          other sequential-movement puzzles) allow any legal move to also be made 
          in reverse. It followed that a solver that could take all possible winning 
          positions as its initial state and perform a full-width search to first 
          find all new states one move from winning, then all new states two moves 
          from winning, etc. would eventually reach some end states from which no 
          new states could be reached. The other sliding block solvers all seemed 
          to be limited to only one initial state, but my solver used an input file 
          that could include any number of states within the computer's processing 
          and memory limits. It was not difficult to write a block-packing program 
          to generate a file containing all the winning states for any given board 
          (grid) and set of block shapes. Running my solver program backward (without 
          specifying a winning state), I was able to find those states the largest 
          number of moves away from the goal and verify that they represented the 
          most difficult possible slide puzzles (those requiring the most moves 
          to solve) for a given grid, set of blocks and goal. </p>
        <p>When I learned about Andrea's
          <a href="new-jwrig.htm">Big-Wriggle challenge</a>, 
          I thought that it could be solved using similar logic, 
          specifying that only the ends of each wriggler could be moved, but that 
          all remaining segments of the same wriggler would follow in order during 
          each move. My revised slide puzzle solver succeeded in improving the best 
          known Big-Wriggle solution from 51 wriggles to 34 wriggles. I also used 
          it to verify the shortest solutions for many of the other 
          <a href="../new-indexw.htm">Wriggle puzzles</a> at Andrea's Clickmazes site.
        </p>
        <p>Of course, the same program could also take a collection of goal 
          states as its input and find those states that were the most wriggles 
          or units of movement away from them. I wrote a packing program to list 
          all of the goal states for a given grid and set of wrigglers and began 
          using it with the reverse solver program to find good Wriggle puzzles. 
          A third program was written to convert my puzzle encodings to Andrea's. 
          As manual entries became tedious, I automated the generation of wriggler 
          lengths and blocker positions into program loops and combined the goal 
          generation, full-width search and encoding translation routines into a 
          single program. This enabled the search of all possible Wriggle puzzles 
          on the four-by-four grid within about 15 minutes of laptop runtime.</p>
        <p>My current Wriggle puzzle-generating program shows all results 
          on-screen as it runs and also saves the best results to a text file which 
          I later convert into Excel format to save and share. Grid sizes of up 
          to five-by-five have been analyzed rather thoroughly, with some additional 
          results for a limited selection of blocker positions on the six-by-five 
          and even the six-by-six grids. More complete analyses of these larger 
          grids are in progress, taking advantage of blocker parity considerations 
          that apply to wrigglers of odd lengths (more on these another time).</p>

        <h4>Wriggle-count versus total-unit-drag</h4>
        <p>Bob has hinted that solution-length for a wriggle puzzle can be measured 
          in one of two ways, <i>total-unit-drag</i> or <i>wriggle-count</i>. Bob's 
          automated program can optimise for either, but on small grids it turns 
          out that optimising to maximise <i>total-unit-drag</i> yields a richer 
          mix of puzzles, better suited to a large collection. Maximising for wriggle-count 
          results in a high percentage of puzzles with only a <i>single blank square</i>, 
          requiring lots of very short wriggles to solve. There are several of these 
          in the 4-wriggler set above, where they begin to dominate due to sheer 
          lack of space on the grid. The larger the grid, the more worthwhile it 
          is to maximise by wriggle-count at least for low-order wriggler grids 
          (on 4x4 it tends to be beneficial for one-wriggler grids only).</p>
          <p>
          <img src="cr20.PNG" width="182" height="215" style="float:right; padding:5px" >
          The fact that there are competing ways to measure solution length 
          (a natural base-line for complexity) is a strong indicator that 
          there is more to these puzzles than meets the eye. What sort of 
          wriggle puzzle is more entertaining? One which requires a lot of 
          short separate wriggles, or one that requires fewer but longer wriggles? 
          It is almost certainly the unexpected long wriggles that give these 
          puzzles their unique appeal, setting them apart from their other 
          sliding-block cousins. To illustrate, the puzzle on the right 
          can be solved in just two separate wriggles (first red, then blue) 
          but the first wriggle is an incredible 17 units long!</p>
          <p>If you are interested in finding the optimum solution for the puzzles 
          featured above, you will find it quoted in square brackets alongside 
          the puzzle title. To be accurate, the number quoted is the <i>minimum 
          total drag</i> required to position the blue wriggler with either 
          its head or tail <i>immediately above the blue exit door</i> (which 
          is two moves short of the congratulations message). As you play, 
          your cumulative wriggle-count [and total-unit-drag] is displayed 
          in the bottom left of the grid. </p>
