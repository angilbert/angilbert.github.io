      <p><B>Welcome to extreme TJ-wriggle! The sample puzzles on this page are 
        a small taste of a large collection of new <a href="ixjwrig.htm">TJ-wriggle</a> 
        puzzles uncovered by Bob Henderson (USA) using automated computer search. 
        Bob has explored many grid sizes from 3x3 upwards, but the 4x4 grid turns 
        out to be the smallest grid where the results start to get exciting, with 
        puzzles exhibiting the depth and variety that we have come to expect from 
        the wriggle-rule.</B> </p>
      <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
        <tr>
          <td valign="top" width="48%"> 
            <p>This page presents the very best of Bob's 4x4 results, the top-20 
              puzzles for one to four wrigglers, giving a total of 80 puzzles 
              to explore. I particularly recommend the <i>2-wriggler</i> &amp; 
              <i>3-wriggler</i> sets. Note that the puzzles in each set are in 
              <i>descending</i> order of solution-length, so the trickiest puzzles 
              tend to be found at the the top of each list, however there are 
              plenty of surprises as you work down each set. To read more about 
              Bob's search engine see below. </p>
            <p>Who would have believed so much complexity was lurking, unexplored, 
              down on the 4x4 grid? Certainly I had no idea! If you enjoyed these 
              puzzles please email us your feedback. Which puzzles were most surprising? 
              Which puzzles proved to be the trickiest?</p>

              Drag the wriggly worms around the maze until you can release the 
              blue wriggler through the light-blue gateway. You can drag by head 
              or tail and it does not matter which end exits first.</p>

      <p><font class="title">Notes on Automated Wriggle Puzzle Generation (by 
        Bob Henderson)<a name="#info"></a></font></p>
      <p align="left">About 20 years ago I entered an annual nationwide puzzle 
        competition in the USA. One of the challenges was to solve a simple sliding 
        block puzzle in the fewest possible moves. Having taken a few computer 
        programming classes and automated the solutions to various block-packing 
        puzzles, I felt sure that sliding-block puzzles would yield to a similar 
        approach. The method I used was a full-width search: finding first all 
        of the positions that could be reached in one move from the initial state, 
        then those that could be reached in two moves, etc. until the goal state 
        was found. It sped up the process considerably to store only the states 
        that had not already been reached, which was most easily handled by storing 
        the new states for each generation in their own file for comparison with 
        states found in later generations. </p>
      <p align="left">As it happened, I won that competition, which led to a deepening 
        interest in slide puzzles. I read L. Edward Hordern's book <a href="http://puzzlemuseum.com/library/SlidinPiecePz.htm"><b>Sliding 
        Piece Puzzles</b></a>, corresponded with David Singmaster (who wrote its 
        foreword), visited <b><a href="http://www.johnrausch.com/SlidingBlockPuzzles/default.htm">Nick 
        Baxter's Sliding Blocks site</a></b>, and provided Nick with several shorter 
        slide puzzle solutions. I collected the sliding block solver software 
        available over the Internet and even had Rik van Grol send me a floppy 
        disc with his own original program allowing human solvers to create and 
        solve slide puzzles on-screen. </p>
      <p align="left">I soon became interested in creating as well as solving 
        such puzzles. The movement rules for most slide puzzles (as well as many 
        other sequential-movement puzzles) allow any legal move to also be made 
        in reverse. It followed that a solver that could take all possible winning 
        positions as its initial state and perform a full-width search to first 
        find all new states one move from winning, then all new states two moves 
        from winning, etc. would eventually reach some end states from which no 
        new states could be reached. The other sliding block solvers all seemed 
        to be limited to only one initial state, but my solver used an input file 
        that could include any number of states within the computer's processing 
        and memory limits. It was not difficult to write a block-packing program 
        to generate a file containing all the winning states for any given board 
        (grid) and set of block shapes. Running my solver program backward (without 
        specifying a winning state), I was able to find those states the largest 
        number of moves away from the goal and verify that they represented the 
        most difficult possible slide puzzles (those requiring the most moves 
        to solve) for a given grid, set of blocks and goal. </p>
      <p align="left">When I learned about Andrea's <b><a href="ixjwrig.htm#iphone">Big-Wriggle 
        challenge</a></b>, I thought that it could be solved using similar logic, 
        specifying that only the ends of each wriggler could be moved, but that 
        all remaining segments of the same wriggler would follow in order during 
        each move. My revised slide puzzle solver succeeded in improving the best 
        known Big-Wriggle solution from 51 wriggles to 34 wriggles. I also used 
        it to verify the shortest solutions for many of the other <b><a href="../indexw.htm">Wriggle 
        puzzles</a></b> at Andrea's Clickmazes site. </p>
      <p align="left">Of course, the same program could also take a collection 
        of goal states as its input and find those states that were the most wriggles 
        or units of movement away from them. I wrote a packing program to list 
        all of the goal states for a given grid and set of wrigglers and began 
        using it with the reverse solver program to find good Wriggle puzzles. 
        A third program was written to convert my puzzle encodings to Andrea's. 
        As manual entries became tedious, I automated the generation of wriggler 
        lengths and blocker positions into program loops and combined the goal 
        generation, full-width search and encoding translation routines into a 
        single program. This enabled the search of all possible Wriggle puzzles 
        on the four-by-four grid within about 15 minutes of laptop runtime. </p>
      <p align="left">My current Wriggle puzzle-generating program shows all results 
        on-screen as it runs and also saves the best results to a text file which 
        I later convert into Excel format to save and share. Grid sizes of up 
        to five-by-five have been analyzed rather thoroughly, with some additional 
        results for a limited selection of blocker positions on the six-by-five 
        and even the six-by-six grids. More complete analyses of these larger 
        grids are in progress, taking advantage of blocker parity considerations 
        that apply to wrigglers of odd lengths (more on these another time).</p>

      <p><font class="title">Wriggle-count versus total-unit-drag</font></p>
      <p>Bob has hinted that solution-length for a wriggle puzzle can be measured 
        in one of two ways, <i>total-unit-drag</i> or <i>wriggle-count</i>. Bob's 
        automated program can optimise for either, but on small grids it turns 
        out that optimising to maximise <i>total-unit-drag</i> yields a richer 
        mix of puzzles, better suited to a large collection. Maximising for wriggle-count 
        results in a high percentage of puzzles with only a <i>single blank square</i>, 
        requiring lots of very short wriggles to solve. There are several of these 
        in the 4-wriggler set above, where they begin to dominate due to sheer 
        lack of space on the grid. The larger the grid, the more worthwhile it 
        is to maximise by wriggle-count at least for low-order wriggler grids 
        (on 4x4 it tends to be beneficial for one-wriggler grids only). </p>
      <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
        <tr> 
          <td valign="top"> 
            <p>The fact that there are competing ways to measure solution length 
              (a natural base-line for complexity) is a strong indicator that 
              there is more to these puzzles than meets the eye. What sort of 
              wriggle puzzle is more entertaining? One which requires a lot of 
              short separate wriggles, or one that requires fewer but longer wriggles? 
              It is almost certainly the unexpected long wriggles that give these 
              puzzles their unique appeal, setting them apart from their other 
              sliding-block cousins. To illustrate, the puzzle on the right (#20 
              from the <b><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/wriggle/id326088352?mt=8">Wriggle 
              iphone app</a></b>) can be solved in just two separate wriggles 
              (first red, then blue) but the first wriggle is an incredible 17 
              units long!</p>
            <p>If you are interested in finding the optimum solution for the puzzles 
              featured above, you will find it quoted in square brackets alongside 
              the puzzle title. To be accurate, the number quoted is the <i>minimum 
              total drag</i> required to position the blue wriggler with either 
              its head or tail <i>immediately above the blue exit door</i> (which 
              is two moves short of the congratulations message). As you play, 
              your cumulative wriggle-count [and total-unit-drag] is displayed 
              in the bottom left of the grid. </p>
