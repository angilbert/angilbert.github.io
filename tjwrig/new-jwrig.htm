        <h2>TJ-wriggle puzzles</h2><p>
          The TJ-wriggle puzzles followed on from the 
          <a href="../wriggle/new-wriggle.htm">original wriggle</a> puzzles
          and quickly established themselves as the most popular variant.
          They are named in honour of Tom Jolly 
          (<a href="http://www.silcom.com/~tomjolly/">www.jollygames.net</a>) 
          who devised the original mechanic and who helped co-develop 
          many new challenges. The set featured below is based on the 6x6 
          grid and up to four wrigglers. The goal is the same in all cases, 
          to release the blue wriggler through the gap at the bottom of the 
          grid. Note that in these puzzles the grey squares are blockers, 
          so the wrigglers effectively reside in a mini-maze.

          <p>Added to the collection in 2009 we also have the <i>big-wriggle 
            bonus challenge</i> which celebrated the 
            launch of the first Wriggle iOS app. The app was later 
            released for MacOS as 
            <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wriggle-3d/id767189857?mt=12">
            Wriggle-3D</a> in 2013.</p>

            <p>Both apps were developed by 
            <a href="http://www.conlanrios.com">Conlan Rios</a> and hopefully one
            day will be refreshed and relaunched. In the meantime there's

            a blog from 2019</a> that reviews the clickmazes wriggle apps, 
            alongside many other apps past and present, based on the wriggle mechanic.</p>
