        <h2>The puffball puzzles</h2><p>
        Welcome to the puffball puzzles. Lots of hot-air on offer here... but 
        use it wisely. You can only move a puffball indirectly, by targeting it 
        with jets-of-air from another puffball. So it will take cunning and forward-planning 
        to achieve the goal.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>The goal is to find the correct sequence of <i>puffs</i> to push all 
        the puffballs onto the pale-pink target squares. Click on any red puffball 
        to trigger a single puff. All other puffballs directly in line, horizontally 
        or vertically, with the active puffball will get pushed away by one square 
        (unless otherwise blocked). Note, you can't push a puffball off the grid, 
        so once it reaches an edge it is stuck there, you might be able to push 
        it along the edge, but never pull it back from the edge. So if you end 
        up with more puffballs than target-squares on any one edge, well... 
        you might want to start again.

        <p><a href="https://itch.io/c/1609485/made-with-puzzlescript-plus">Puzzlescript Plus</a> 
        (maintained by <a href="https://auroriax.itch.io">Auroriax</a>) 
        was adopted for this port in order to make use of the all-important mouse-support. 
        Various other PS+ specific features were utilised including level-select, tweening and 
        sprite cloning. Most notably in this case there is a single, universal, extra-large (15x15) 
        sprite that is copied and repainted to represent every single graphical element 
        that you see on screen. A hackable version of the app is available
        <a href="https://auroriax.github.io/PuzzleScript/editor.html?hack=ab9cf51df6fc82ab54b67541c6736ca1">here</a>.
