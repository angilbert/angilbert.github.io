        <h2>The puff-ball puzzles</h2><p>
        Welcome to the puff-ball puzzles. Lots of hot-air on offer here ... but 
        use it wisely. You can only move a puff-ball indirectly, by targeting it 
        with jets-of-air from another puff-ball. So it will take cunning and forward-planning 
        to achieve the goal.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>The goal is to find the correct sequence of <i>puffs</i> to push all 
        the puff-balls onto the pale-pink target squares. Click on any red puff-ball 
        to trigger a single puff. All other puff-balls directly in line, horizontally 
        or vertically, with the active puff-ball will get pushed away by one square 
        (unless otherwise blocked). Note, you can't push a puff-ball off the grid, 
        so once it reaches an edge it is stuck there, you might be able to push 
        it along the edge, but never pull it back from the edge. So if you end 
        up with more puff-balls than target-squares on any one edge, well ... 
        you might want to start again.
