        <h2>Switch-back</h2><p>
          A route-finding, route-building  puzzle game with two 
          dissimilar but mutually dependent mechanics. 
          Coordinate red and blue to solve the puzzles.

        Red can move only on the grey paths (speckled or solid) whereas 
        blue can move anywhere. Speckled grey path blocks will adhere to blue, 
        effectively mutating the space that red can reach. Red will activate 
        blue if it steps onto one of the plus-shape buttons. Blue will 
        activate red if it pushes itself over red.  If that sounds 
        convoluted, I suggest you just give it a go. The tutorial levels
        will teach you what you need to know.

        <h4>Footnotes</h4><p>
        Switch-back is a first foray into what can be achieved with 
        puzzlescript by deliberately mixing up the normal conventions of game 
        play. Different puzzlescript sprites obey different rules, naturally, but 
        typically only one type of sprite is nominated the 'player'. So what 
        is achievable if you break this convention? Switch-back set out to 
        explore this, although it is only the smallest first step down an 
        infinite line of variations. A line I hope to revisit soon.
