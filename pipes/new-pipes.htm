        <h2>Pipe mazes - 1998 to 2023</h2>
        <p>It's been over 25 years since clickmazes was first online. To mark the quarter 
          century I dug deep into my archives for something that was part of that pre-Y2K
          debut, but never actually made it into interactive form.

      <div class="std-flex-block">

          <p>Some of the earliest content at clickmazes were static structured mazes 
            based on repeated patterns of interwoven pathways or pipework.
            I would start by crafting a small unit-tile that would naturally tesselate
            leaving no internal loose ends. Laying these tiles in an array would give
            me a template design of any desired size. 
            From the template I could then hand-craft many mazes, by adjusting the 
            internal pipework structure to create the necessary junctions and loops.

          <p>My oldest hand-drawn pipe-maze I still have a copy of is dated 1984,
            however the interactive collection below starts with my
            <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rOEaTVWYsrXEV1DxAg-F-6gJKawhxnrU/view?usp=share_link">first digitised (BMP) design</a>
            dated 1998. 
            There follows four more mazes from my archives and finally 
            one brand new maze, to create a mini-collection that spans the 
            full quarter century. The six mazes are in order of creation, not difficulty, 
            but you can use the puzzlescript-plus level-select menu to explore 
            them in any order.
