    The Orientation Maze</H2>

    <P><FONT CLASS="note"><B>Gathering for Gardner V<BR>

    <P>The Orientation maze is a new type of multi-state arrow maze
    where your current orientation plays a key role. This maze works
    especially well as a full-size walk-on maze (I find post-it notes
    stuck to the carpet perfectly adequate) however it can also work
    on paper, as illustrated here. Simply use a finger to mark your
    current position and rotate the paper under your finger to change
    orientation.</P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Aim</FONT></B><BR>
    Your aim is to move from the start dot (in the south) to the
    end dot (in the north). You must enter the maze facing north,
    but can finish in any orientation. See full size diagram at bottom
    of page.</P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Movement</FONT></B><BR>
    Each move is either a single step to an adjacent square or else
    a quarter turn. At each move your possible choices are indicated
    by the column of symbols you can see straight ahead of you (note,
    you cannot use the symbol under your feet). This means initially
    you have four options, but once into the maze the maximum is
    three. You will see in Figure1 that the four options at the start
    are (from the top) step left, step forward, rotate left or step
    back, however, since you must stay on grid at all times the only
    meaningful first move is step-forward. The choices at the second
    move are then step left, step forward or rotate left (see Figure
    2). For move two you could thus chose to rotate left a quarter
    turn, and the result of this move is illustrated in Figure 3.
    Note that the circle of arrows indicates the direction you rotate
    (the paper rotates in the opposite direction). So, from Figure
    3, what&#146;s your next possible move? Well you have only one
    square in front of you with an arrow facing to your (now) right,
    so that&#146;s a forced move, one step right. <BR>

    <P>Note, if you find yourself at the edge of the maze facing
    out, or being forced off the grid, then you have found a dead-end
    and must start again. That&#146;s all there is to it. Remember
    at all times you can only move according to the arrows you can
    see in the column straight ahead of you. Only rotate if you see
    a rotate symbol, and make sure you rotate in the right direction.</P>
