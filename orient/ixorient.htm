    The Orientation maze</H2>

    <P><B>The orientation maze (O-maze) is a new style of multi-state
    arrow maze where your choices at each move are dictated by your
    orientation and the symbols you can see directly ahead of you.
    In this maze 'you' are represented by a red pointer, and the
    symbols in the maze are arrows that give you the option to move
    one square left, right, up or down, or rotate you ninety-degrees
    left or right.</B></P>

    <P><B>T</B>his first set of puzzles are straight mazes with no
    obstacles. All mazes were produced by Jimmy Stephens's OrientExpress
    puzzle generator. Read more about OrientExpress below, or visit
    <B><A HREF="http://www.puzzlebeast.com/">www.puzzlebeast.com</A></B>
    to explore more of Jimmy's computer generated puzzles.</P>

    <P>This second set of puzzles include one or more blue obstacles
    called 'switchers', which hide one symbol from view and will
    switch places with the red pointer if the pointer is pushed onto
    the same square. Thus the switcher is a moveable obstacle. The
    switcher hugely increases the number of possible states in the
    maze, and thus the average length of solution. These challenges
    were all created by OrientExtress puzzle generator.</P>

    <P>The one and only hand-crafted orientation maze currently in
    existance is the one I devised for G4G5 in Atlanta in April 2002.
    You can find the original maze <B><A HREF="g4g5.htm">here</A></B>.
    It was not until I saw the results of OrientExpress however that
    I realised just how much complexity and variety was possible
    on a 4x4 grid. Infact no O-maze featured on these pages is any
    larger than 4x4, which is remarkable considering most of my other
    puzzles start at 5x5. It turns out O-maze works best on 4x4,
    5x5 works reasonably well too but there is little gain in complexity
    and with anything larger than 5x5 the maze-like behaviour begins
    to breakdown (due to having too many options at each turn). The
    O-maze is a good example of just how small and complex a multi-state
    maze can be.</P>

    <P><FONT CLASS="title">Notes from the Author</FONT></P>

    <P><IMG SRC="express.gif" WIDTH="340" HEIGHT="318" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0" >The OrientExpress program for
    generating orientation mazes was written with the benefit of
    the experience gained from developing SwampBeast, the plank puzzle
    generator (see <B><A HREF="http://www.puzzlebeast.com/">www.puzzlebeast.com</A></B>).
    Although the two types of puzzles are very different, the routines
    used for the puzzle solver module and for the random generation
    and mutation modules are quite similar between the two programs.</P>

    <P>A screen-shot of an early version of OrientExpress is shown
    on the right. As with SwampBeast, this program creates puzzles
    first by randomly generating a large number of mazes, saving
    only the ones which look the most promising. The top candidates
    are then subjected to random mutations, again saving only the
    best puzzles. The puzzles posted above typically resulted from
    several tens of thousands of random generation steps, followed
    by a similar number of random mutation steps.</P>

    <P>To identify 'promising' puzzles, a method is needed for scoring
    puzzles once they are created. Ideally, this score should be
    an estimate of how difficult and/or fun the maze is to solve.
    Since the basic mechanics for puzzle creation and solving had
    already been developed for SwampBeast, much of the challenge
    in developing OrientExpress came in finding a good scoring metric.</P>

    <P>The puzzles created early on were simpler in that they did
    not have switchers, and the length of the solution path was used
    as the sole measure for scoring these puzzles. However, when
    the switchers were added, scoring became more complicated. With
    switchers it became possible for the solution path to have repetitive
    loops in it, a feature you will notice in many of the puzzles.
    (For example, see puzzle #2 in the second set of puzzles above.)
    In fact, virtually all of the switcher puzzles OrientExpress
    initially produced proved to be very long, and very, very repetitive.
    Solving a few puzzles of this type was fun, but after solving
    a couple of dozen of them, the repetitive nature became a colossal
    drag.</P>

    <P>So, new scoring methods were tested in an effort to bump OrientExpress
    out of it's loopiness. After some trial and error, the most successful
    metric proved to be one I call Entropy Scoring. It is based on
    the assumption that solution paths with high entropy will have
    more unexpected twists and turns, and will therefore be more
    interesting and difficult. (See puzzles #1, 3, 8-11, 13-16, in
    second set of puzzles above for puzzles created using Entropy
    Scoring.) In practice, mazes generated using this metric proved
    to be much less repetitive, and do in fact seem to be more difficult
    to solve for a given solution length.</P>
