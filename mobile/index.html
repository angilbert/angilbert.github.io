      <p>Ever since Apple introduced the iPhone we have faced regular requests, 
        from fans of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Clickmazes</span>, to develop 
        the puzzles for mobile devices. <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/wriggle/id326088352"><b>Wriggle</b></a> 
        was developed for the App Store in 2009 by <a href="http://www.conlanrios.com"><b>Conlan 
        Rios</b></a> in collaboration with Andrea and Tom Jolly, and has already 
        proven enormously popular.&nbsp; I (Bill) have now retired from the day-job, 
        which has given me time to take up the challenge of app development for 
        myself. As a result, we have just published another clickmazes puzzle 
        on the App Store store, this time it's the<b> BoxUp</b> puzzle. The <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/clickmazes-boxup/id512061618"><b>Clickmazes 
        BoxUp app</b></a> has been developed entirely in-house at clickmazes by 
        Bill and Andrea, with puzzle layouts by Bob Henderson. </p>

      <p>There's over a hundred puzzles to solve in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">BoxUp</span> 
        app, and we've included some unique and novel features, such as an animated 
        puzzle solver. The solver allows you to view the solutions of puzzles, 
        even those that you have not yet solved, <b>and that's not cheating! </b>If 
        you view the solution of an unsolved puzzle you will, however, be prevented 
        from attempting the puzzle yourself until a period of five minutes has 
        passed. If you are able to memorise the entire solution, and to recall 
        it five minutes later, then you will be awarded a full score. But don't 
        assume that'll be easy!</p>
      <h3>Good news for iPad users<br>
      </h3>
      <p>We don't think iPad owners will be disappointed as BoxUp has been designed 
        from the outset not just for iPhone and iPod Touch, but also for iPad.&nbsp; 
        All BoxUp screens support auto rotation on iPad, for example, with appropriate 
        adjustments to the layout to make best use of whichever orientation is 
        preferred.&nbsp; BoxUp also uses iPad 'pop overs' (partial screen overlays) 
        to avoid the tiresome and unnecessary screen switching that is often associated 
        with apps that treated iPad as an afterthought.<br>
      </p>
      <h3>A little tip from Bill<br>
</h3>
      <p>I personally recommend that you take some time, when getting started with 
        Clickmazes BoxUp, to view a few of the puzzle solutions. The longer
ones are great fun to watch, plus you'll get to see some of the tricks and tactics
that are necessary when solving them for yourself.&nbsp; Just
select a puzzle from the list, press the <span style="font-style: italic;">i</span> button to be taken to the <span style="font-style: italic;">information </span>screen, then press the <span style="font-style: italic;">Optimum Solution</span> button.<br>
      </p>
