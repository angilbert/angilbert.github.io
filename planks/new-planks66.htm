        <h2>6x6 plank-puzzle collection</h2><p>
          Introducing a collection of new plank puzzles 
          to accompany the clickmazes 2020 reboot focussed on 
          exploiting the 6x6 grid. Each puzzle below utilises a different 
          combination of planks (lengths 1, 2, 3 and 4) and up to 6 
          planks total.</p>
      </div>
      <div><p>
        These puzzles start easy and ramp up pretty quickly. 
        The intention was not however to tease-out the hardest possible 
        puzzle with each plank combination, it was to explore the extra 
        variety that one extra row and column could offer. 
        After many hundreds of man-hours eeking the very best out of  
        the 5x5 grid, I felt I had exhausted all aspects of its
        puzzling capacity.
        So was there something new to discover on 6x6? 
        Was P4 a useful or interesting addition? 
        Could an extra P2 or P3 add an extra AHA?</p><p>
        In a future update I plan to document what 20 years of 
        swamp exploration has taught me and analyse the different 
        strategies that underpin a good design.
        For now, I will leave you to explore...</p>

        <h4>Motivation - secondary goal</h4><p>
          There was a secondary goal in hand-designing this 
          new collection, which was to try and beat an early record 
          set by <a href="new-beast.htm">SwampBeast</a> of 36 moves (on the 6x6 grid). 
          The final puzzle achieves this with a shortest solution of 38 plank moves. 
          Despite the many years refining my designing skills on the 5x5 grid, the 
          challenge of beating SwampBeast was harder than I expected. 
          And to be fair to SwampBeast it was configured to search with just 3 
          planks only (lengths 1,2,3) and to stop when it hit 36 moves. So, kudos to
          SwampBeast (as always) and I think this leaves an intriguing open question... 
          could Swampbeast, or a similar puzzle-mutation-engine, 
          further improve on <i>abbc-38</i> if it was given it as a 
          starting point? 
        </p>
        <h4>Implementation note</h4>
        <p>The observant may well notice that the swamp here looks somewhat
          different compared with previous pages.
          This is because it a fresh 
          <a href="http://www.brambleshadow4.net/code/plank-puzzles/">
            implementation in HTML5</a> provided by Jeremy Miller of 
            Cornell University in 2017.
          Aside from the colour-scheme the key notable difference is that 
          the accessible planks are highlighted in this version, rather 
          than the accessible tree-stumps.
