        <h4>History (2000/2001)</h4>
        <p><i>Fiendish</i> was devised by hand over a period of several
        days. My sole aim was to improve on my previous best (<i>Route-66</i>)
        which I had stumbled on more by luck than judgement and was
        a big leap forward in its time. A nifty windows-based (C++)
        plank-puzzle editor/solver (by applet author, Graham) was used to 
        verify the solution. <i>Fiendish</i> is actually shorter than 
        <i>Route-66</i>, but more complex and compact, as (hopefully) 
        illustrated in the following table. </p>

        <p>During the first few heady months of plank puzzle exploration I 
        fixed on the notion that the best way to measure plank puzzle complexity 
        was by <i>move-over-span ratio</i> which is why I initially ranked 
        <i>Fiendish</i> above <i>Route-66</i>. Until March 2001 <i>Fiendish</i> 
        and <i>Route-66</i> were the only two puzzles with a <b>move-over-span 
        ratio greater than 1</b> (meaning the number of moves actually exceeds 
        the number of possible plank positions).</p>

        <div class="table-block">
          <table class="std-table">
          <tr> 
            <th width="150px">&nbsp;</th> 
            <th width="120px">Route-66</th> 
            <th width="120px">Fiendish</th> 
          </tr>
          <tr><td><b>Grid</b></td> <td>9x9 (square)</td> <td>8x8 (square)</td> </tr>
          <tr><td><b>Planks</b></td> <td>3 (1+2+3)</td> <td>4 (1+2+3+4)</td> </tr>
          <tr><td><b>Shortest solution</b></td> <td>66 moves</td> <td>57 moves</td> </tr> 
          <tr><td><b>Span count</b></td> <td>54</td> <td>40</td> </tr>
          <tr><td><b>Move/span ratio</b></td> <td>1.22</td> <td>1.42</td> </tr>
        </table>
        </div>
        <p>However... In March 2001 Pascal Wassong well and truly smashed my 
        <i>move-over-span ratio</i> record with a plank-puzzle of his own 
        design entitled <a href="new-tcf.htm">The Centrifugal Force</a> 
        (TCF for short). TCF requires an incredible <b>342</b> moves and has a 
        move-over-span ratio of <b>4.62</b>.</p>
