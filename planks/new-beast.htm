        <h2>Plank puzzles by SwampBeast</h2>
          <p>This page offers a challenging selection of 
            <a href="./new-planks.htm">plank puzzles</a>
            generated by a program called <i>SwampBeast</i> in 2002. If you think you
            have plank puzzles sussed then I recommend you try out some of the 10x10s

        <h4>Notes from the Author (2002)</h4>
        <p>SwampBeast is a Java application which consists of two basic
          modules, a puzzle generator and a puzzle mutator. The puzzle
          generator creates a large number of random puzzles, and attempts
          to solve each one. If a puzzle can be solved, it is assigned
          a score which reflects (at least in theory) the difficulty of
          the puzzle.</p>
      
          <p>The puzzle mutator takes the best puzzle from the generator
          and applies a variety of mutations such as moving planks, adding,
          deleting or moving stumps, etc. Higher scoring mutations are
          retained in place of the original puzzle. A typical puzzle on
          this page is the result of perhaps 100,000 generation steps followed
          by 10,000 or more mutation steps.</p>
      
          <p>The scoring algorithm continues to evolve from the first versions
          of SwampBeast. In the early days the scoring criteria were chosen
          to produce puzzles with long solutions, and as a result many
          of the puzzles had a large number of &quot;flip-flop&quot; moves,
          i.e. sequential moves using the same plank. The criteria were
          subsequently adjusted to explicitly discount flip-flop moves
          by shorter planks, and as expected the resulting puzzles proved
          to be harder to solve. The current criteria also give a higher
          score to solutions that make frequent changes in the set of active
          planks.</p>
      
          <p>Another twist on SwampBeast puzzles is the use of priming
          patterns. Rather than starting with a totally random puzzle,
          the grid is primed with a pattern designed to maximise the use
          of the longer planks. <i>Pennsylvania Avenue</i>, <i>Special
          Delivery</i>, and <i>Parallel Universe</i> were produced using
          priming patterns with diagonal corridors through the puzzle.
          These patterns were distorted somewhat in the mutation process.
          (although, surprisingly, the pattern remained completely intact
          through the mutation steps for <i>Parallel Universe</i>.)</p>
