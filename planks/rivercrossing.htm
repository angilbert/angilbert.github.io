        40 staged puzzles (beginner, intermediate, advanced and expert)
        on a 5x5 grid. The puzzles utilise up to five planks (two small
        planks, two medium planks and one large plank). Age range 8 to
        adult, with the second half of the puzzle set amply difficult
        to tax most grown-ups.</TD>

        This is an expansion set, so you must have the original to start
        with. There is a brand new set of 40 puzzles across an extended
        range of difficulty levels (including grand-master level). The
        puzzles are still based on the same grid, but in many cases exploit
        the holes previously reserved for the river-banks yielding effectively
        a 7x5 grid. There is a selection of standard (solo) hiker challenges,
        followed by a range of new dog-rescue and dog-and-hiker crossing
        challenges (including some of my own personal all-time favourite
        puzzles). The age range is again 8 to adult, but even I regularly
        forget how to solve the grand-master challenges, so grown-ups
        beware.</TD>

        A completely new set of 40 puzzles aimed at the younger age group
        (5-12). All challenges are effectively limited to a 4x4 grid
        to cap the complexity level. The puzzles include 20 standard
        river-crossing puzzles and 20 cat-rescue challenges. The game
        comes with a choice of boy or girl hiker to keep both sexes happy.</TD>

        A 'remake' of the now multi-award winning original, but with
        a super-hero theme. The puzzle set is the same as the original,
        but if you can't swim, or happen to be a qualified trapeze artist,
        this is definitely the set for you.</TD>
