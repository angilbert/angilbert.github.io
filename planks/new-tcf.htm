        <h2>The Centrifugal Force</h2><p>
          &quot;Hello... I recently discovered the Plank Mazes by
          Andrea Gilbert at the mathpuzzle.com and www.clickmazes.com web
          sites. I solved some of these mazes but not all. When I read
          the comments about <i>Route 66</i> and <i>Fiendish</i> being
          the only mazes having a move/span ratio greater than one, I immediately
          thought that it should be possible to do better. Below is the
          result of my work on this idea...&quot; 
          <i>(Pascal Wassong - March 2001)</i>

        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p><i>The Centrifugal Force </i>(TCF) was designed by Pascal
          to demonstrate that it is possible to attain exceedingly high
          <i>move-over-span ratios </i>by concentrating on one of the 
          plank-puzzle's
          movement rules and crafting a very long solution using as fewer
          stumps as possible. Here are the full figures for TCF compared
          with <i>Route-66</i> and <i>Fiendish</i>.

          As Pascal points out himself, TCF is not difficult to
          solve. There is a big loop using the two shortest planks and
          each time you move the longest plank, you open but also close
          a 'valve' on this loop, which forces you to re-walk the loop.
          The span diagram for TCF (right) illustrates this long loop 
          clearly.</p>
          <p>TCF relies almost completely on the 
          <i>planks-cannot-cross</i> rule to create the valve-effect, 
          however this puzzle also
          illustrates one of the key plank-puzzle strategies; how it is
          often necessary to 'drag' a plank along so as not to lose it
          (even though you don't actually use it for several moves). Within
          the long loop (pink/red) you can see several instances of the small
          plank (P1/red) being dragged along by the medium plank (P2/pink).
        </p>
        <p>
          TCF effectively illustrates that the move-over-span ratio
          is not a good measure of plank-puzzle difficulty. There is plenty
          of spare space in TCF into which additional stumps could be placed
          that would hide or confuse the true-path (solution) without shortening
          it. Effectively each additional stump <i>increases</i> the difficulty
          of the puzzle yet, by increasing the span count, automatically
          <i>decreases</i> the ratio.
        </p>
        <p>I finish with a quote from Pascal... 
          &quot;<i>The name of the
          problem comes from a famous chess retro-analysis problem by Dr.
          Luigi Ceriani where a King had to make a round trip on the chessboard
          to unlock a position ... I regularly compose chess problems.
          Mostly, making them difficult to solve is not what I have in
          mind when I compose a problem. I have generally one idea that
          I want to show to the solvers (or to any person interested, even
          if they just look at the solution). And to show an idea, it is
          even better that the problem is easy to solve so that one can
          focus on it. This is exactly what my purpose was while creating
          TCF : just showing one thing that can be done with these 
          rules</i>&quot;.
