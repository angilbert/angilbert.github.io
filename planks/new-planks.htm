        <h2>Original planks</h2><p>
          You challenge is to find a route across a 
          crocodile infested swamp using an inadequate selection of rather short 
          planks. Thankfully the planks are light enough to move around and the 
          swamp is full of old tree-stumps which will support the planks to form 
          temporary bridges. So with careful planning and judicious re-use of 
          planks you might just find a route. Needless to say you can only move
          planks you can physically reach so try not to leave a plank 
          behind unless there is good reason to do so.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>The best way to visualise the problem is to
          imagine yourself stuck in a real swamp, with tree-stumps too
          far apart to jump-between and planks too heavy to move more
          than one at a time. The remaining rules get a bit fiddley but
          here they all are. I recommend you try the <i>warm-up</i> 
          puzzles below to explore the rules properly.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You can pick up and carry a plank provided you have access to one end.</li>
            <li>You can only pick-up and carry <b>one</b> plank at a time.</li>
            <li>Planks must be supported both ends, and must be an <b>exact</b> fit.</li>
            <li>You <b>cannot</b> jump between stumps or planks.</li>
            <li>You <b>cannot</b> move a plank if you are already carrying one.</li>
            <li>Planks <b>cannot</b> be used diagonally, only north-south or east-west.</li>
            <li>Planks <b>cannot</b> support other planks, and cannot be stacked.</li>
            <li>Planks <b>cannot</b> bridge intermediate stumps or planks.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Two of five</h4>
          <p>Here are two of the original five puzzles which existed when 
          the plank puzzles first went on-line in July 2000.</p>
          <p><i>Deep-end</i> (as in in-at-the...) was the first published
          puzzle for the 5x5 grid and for a long time the only one because
          I deemed the grid rather too small to be worthy of much attention.</p>
          <p>Ironically, over the subsequent 10 years, I ended up hand-crafting
          hundreds more 5x5 puzzles to cater for three editions of the
          <a href="https://www.thinkfun.co.uk/products/river-crossing/">
          River Crossing</a> puzzle sets. 
          I could not have been more wrong about its potential! </p>

          <h4>Route-66</h4>
          <p><i>Route-66</i> was one of the early large-grid plank-puzzles,
            designed by hand, long before there was any automated tools
            to check for short-cuts and verify shortest path.
            Manual checks seemed to indicate it took at least 66 moves 
            (plank relocations) to solve which at the time seemed 
            astounding and likely to be proven wrong (it was ultimately 
            proven correct).</p>
