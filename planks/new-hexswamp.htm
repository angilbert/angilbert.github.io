        <h2>The vexing hex-swamps</h2><p>
          The hex-based swamp is a variation of the plank puzzle
          concept proposed by applet-author
          <a href="http://www.henleymob.co.uk">Graham</a>.
          The hexagonal grid opens up a few more
          puzzling conundrums for intrepid swamp explorers to deal
          with, one obvious one being the choice of direction
          approaching the exit stump. Do you approach from above
          or from the left? A maze that offers a choice of exit routes
          is probably offering a <i>white-hole</i> and only one of 
          those exit routes is reachable. If you are inclined to
          try and work a maze backwards, a white-hole is an extra 
          hurdle to deal with.

          The first puzzle here is called <i>Four-by-four</i> 
          by virtue of being the first to feature exactly four planks 
          (lengths 1, 2, 3 and 4). There are more hex-swamps to explore at 
          the applet's home web-site 
          (<a href="http://www.henleymob.co.uk/Planks/planks.html">Henleymob</a>).
          Many of the hex-swamps play on the word <i>Twist</i> thanks to their 
          unique ability to seemingly spin you on one spot.</p>
