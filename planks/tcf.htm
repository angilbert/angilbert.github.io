    The Centrifugal Force</H2>

    <P><B>&quot;Hello... I recently discovered the Plank Mazes by
    Andrea Gilbert at the mathpuzzle.com and www.clickmazes.com web
    sites. I solved some of these mazes but not all. When I read
    the comments about <I>Route 66</I> and <I>Fiendish</I> being
    the only mazes having a move/span ratio greater than one, I immediately
    thought that it should be possible to do better. Below is the
    result of my work on this idea...&quot; </B><I>(Pascal Wassong
    - March 2001)</I></P>

    <P><I>The Centrifugal Force </I>(TCF) was designed by Pascal
    to demonstrate that it is possible to attain exceedingly high
    <I>move-over-span ratios </I>by concentrating on one of the plank-puzzle's
    movement rules and crafting a very long solution using as fewer
    stumps as possible. Here are the full figures for TCF compared
    with <I>Route-66</I> and <I>Fiendish</I>.</P>

    <P>As Pascal points out himself, this maze is not difficult to
    solve. There is a big loop using the two shortest planks and
    each time you move the longest plank, you open but also close
    a 'valve' on this loop, which forces you to re-walk the loop.
    The span diagram for TCF (below) illustrates this long loop very
    well. Note, TCF relies almost completely on the <I>planks-cannot-cross
    </I>rule to create the valve-effect, however this diagram also
    illustrates one of the key plank-puzzle strategies; how it is
    often necessary to 'drag' a plank along so as not to lose it
    (even though you don't actually use it for several moves). Within
    the long loop below you can see several instances of the small
    plank (P1) being dragged along by the medium plank (P2).</P>

    <P><CENTER><IMG SRC="tcf_span.gif" WIDTH="404" HEIGHT="377" 
    ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" ></CENTER></P>

    <P>TCF has effectively illustrated that the move-over-span ratio
    is not a good measure of plank-puzzle difficulty. There is plenty
    of spare space in TCF into which additional stumps could be placed
    that would hide or confuse the true-path (solution) without shortening
    it. Effectively each additional stump <I>increases</I> the difficulty
    of the puzzle yet, by increasing the span count, automatically
    <I>decreases</I> the ratio.</P>

    <P>I finish with a quote from Pascal... &quot;The name of the
    problem comes from a famous chess retro-analysis problem by Dr.
    Luigi Ceriani where a King had to make a round trip on the chessboard
    to unlock a position ... I regularly compose chess problems.
    Mostly, making them difficult to solve is not what I have in
    mind when I compose a problem. I have generally one idea that
    I want to show to the solvers (or to any person interested, even
    if they just look at the solution). And to show an idea, it is
    even better that the problem is easy to solve so that one can
    focus on it. This is exactly what my purpose was while creating
    TCF : just showing one thing that can be done with these rules&quot;.</P>
