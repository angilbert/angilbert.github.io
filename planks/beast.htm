    Plank puzzles by SwampBeast</H2>

    <P><B>This page offers a challenging new selection of plank puzzles
    generated by a java program called SwampBeast. If you think you
    have plank puzzles sussed then I recommend you try out some of
    the 10x10s below and see if you still survive. The rules for
    the plank puzzles are not repeated here; visit any other plank
    puzzle page for a reminder (important note... if you haven't
    tried plank puzzles before, this is not the place to start!).
    SwampBeast was written by James Stephens of Atlanta, Georgia,
    USA (<A HREF="http://www.puzzlebeast.com/">www.puzzlebeast.com</A>).

    <P>Having never before encountered a plank puzzle I didn't design
    myself, I have thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to try solving
    some over the last few weeks, and indeed still have several of
    the 10x10s left to conquer. One of my early favourites was Trebuchet,
    which originally had only 81 moves, but hardly touched the top
    right corner. I couldn't help putting my designer hat back on
    and searching for an improvement. It wasn't easy, but eventually
    I managed to squeeze out an extra 12 moves, creating Trebuchet
    V2 as now featured.</P>

    <P>SwampBeast is a Java application which consists of two basic
    modules, a puzzle generator and a puzzle mutator. The puzzle
    generator creates a large number of random puzzles, and attempts
    to solve each one. If a puzzle can be solved, it is assigned
    a score which reflects (at least in theory) the difficulty of
    the puzzle.</P>

    <P>The puzzle mutator takes the best puzzle from the generator
    and applies a variety of mutations such as moving planks, adding,
    deleting or moving stumps, etc. Higher scoring mutations are
    retained in place of the original puzzle. A typical puzzle on
    this page is the result of perhaps 100,000 generation steps followed
    by 10,000 or more mutation steps.</P>

    <P>The scoring algorithm continues to evolve from the first versions
    of SwampBeast. In the early days the scoring criteria were chosen
    to produce puzzles with long solutions, and as a result many
    of the puzzles had a large number of &quot;flip-flop&quot; moves,
    i.e. sequential moves using the same plank. The criteria were
    subsequently adjusted to explicitly discount flip-flop moves
    by shorter planks, and as expected the resulting puzzles proved
    to be harder to solve. The current criteria also give a higher
    score to solutions that make frequent changes in the set of active
    planks.</P>

    <P>Another twist on SwampBeast puzzles is the use of priming
    patterns. Rather than starting with a totally random puzzle,
    the grid is primed with a pattern designed to maximise the use
    of the longer planks. <I>Pennsylvania Avenue</I>, <I>Special
    Delivery</I>, and <I>Parallel Universe</I> were produced using
    priming patterns with diagonal corridors through the puzzle.
    These patterns were distorted somewhat in the mutation process.
    (although, surprisingly, the pattern remained completely intact
    through the mutation steps for <I>Parallel Universe</I>.)</P>
