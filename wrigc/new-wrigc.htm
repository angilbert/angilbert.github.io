        <h2>Colour-wriggle mazes</h2><p>
          As in the original <a href="../wriggle/new-wriggle.htm">wriggle puzzles</a> 
          there are no fixed obstacles in these puzzles, except for the wriggler itself. 
          The added twist here however, is that the wriggler can never occupy two 
          cells of the same colour (so all occupied cells must be different colours 
          at all times). Note, there is always one extra colour on the grid compared 
          with the length of the wriggler, this balance was found to yield the perfect 
          degree of connectivity for a good maze.

          The applet below can be run in one of three modes. In <b><i>no-walls</i>
          </b>mode (the default) you are given no visual clues as to which
          moves are legal. In <b><i>top-n-tail </i></b>mode walls are drawn
          around the head and tail of the worm to indicate which immediately
          available moves are valid. In<i> <b>tunnel</b> </i>mode all walls
          are initially displayed but will disappear (and reappear) following
          the top-n-tail rule. The visual mode has no impact on the maze
          itself, but <i>top-no-tail</i> and <i>tunnel </i>mode give more
          visual feedback to guide you through the maze, use whichever
          mode suits you best.
