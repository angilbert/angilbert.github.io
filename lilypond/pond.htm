        <h2>Lily-pond</h2><p>
          Explore the serene world of the lily-pond and its surrounding water-gardens. 
          Tiptoe across the delicate lily-pads, gather seed-pods, grow new lily-pads and 
          master the natural lifecycle of the lily to delve deep into the watery 
          wonderland. A route-finding, resource-management puzzle-game with a 
          novel core mechanic.

            This game makes extensive use of PSNext features, including level select, 
          canvas sprites, smoothscreen (zoom) and checkpoints. Some familiarity with 
          the puzzlescript UI is assumed and not repeated here. Suffice to say,  
          PS games are best played on desk/laptop with a keyboard. If you know 
          the PS UI well and feel brave enough to play on mobile I recommend you 
          click "play full window" first. </p>

          This puzzle concept was conceived late summer 2024 and remains in 
          active development.
          To date (April 2025) there are six chapters close to finalised and two 
          more planned (this page currently offers the first four chapters only). 
          Later chapters will focus on the various "rules of five", the first of 
          which is introduced in the chapter 4.
        </p><p>
            <img src="./mud.png" width="100" style="float:left; padding:10px" > 
          Each chapter (level) has been woven together from a large collection of 
          small discrete puzzles which were individually hand-designed to showcase 
          different aspects of the puzzle mechanic. 
          You beat a level by collecting at least three rare Andreana lily blooms
          (each chapter contains five) and some are more challenging than others. 
          The ultimate goal is to find all twenty, spread across the four 
          available chapters.
          </p><p>

          The game has a restricted view centered on the player (which looks better
          on small screens). This gives the game a little bit of a dungeon-crawl 
          feel and means you may occasionally need to explore beyond the visible 
          boundary to deduce the correct way forward. Undo is your friend!
          Checkpoints are provided to track progress through each chapter. They 
          only trigger on the first visit and remain visible once triggered.
