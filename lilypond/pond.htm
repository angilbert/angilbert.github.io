        <h2>Lily-pond</h2><p>
          Explore the serene world of the lily-pond and it's surrounding water-gardens. 
          Tiptoe across the delicate lily-pads, hunt for seed-pods, grow new lily-pads and 
          master the natural lifecycle of the flora and fauna to delve deep into 
          the watery wonderland. A route-finding, resource-management puzzle-game with a 
          novel core mechanic.

        This puzzle concept was conceived in the summer of 2024 and has been in 
        incremental development since then. To date (March 2025) there are six 
        chapters close to finalised and two more planned. This page currently offers 
        the first four chapters only.</p>

        <p>
           This game makes extensive use of PSNext features, including level select, 
           canvas sprites, smoothscreen (for zoom and movement) and also checkpoints. 
           Each chapter (level) is effectively a collection of discrete puzzles 
           (typically 6-10) which must be tackled in the right order to fully beat 
           the level. Each chapter introduces one new aspect of the core mechanic 
           and methodically explores its puzzling potential.
           </p><p>
           The chapters (levels) are not "open-world" but different routes forward 
           will often present themselves (especially in later chapters), part of the 
           challenge is then deducing the correct route forward. 
           The game is restricted to a 13x13 view centered on the player (primarily to
           improve mobile support) so occasionally you may need to explore a little to 
           fully scope the next goal, but the restricted view is never deliberately 
           exploited to obfuscate the next goal.
          </p><p>
           Checkpoints serve two purposes, firstly they allow you to revert back to a trusted
           state on the solution path. Secondly they offer a portal to skip you forward
           to the next checkpoint (hint: search in the reeds). 
           At the moment you can also exit onto "the lawns" and re-enter the level near other 
           checkpoints. You cannot carry seeds-pods through portals or across the lawns.

           <!-- Checkpoints are invisible until you first 
           reach them. That said, they also act as hints, if you need them. Simply jump 
           through the portal (then undo) to give a clear indicator of your next goal. 
           Note... if you hit a new checkpoint carrying seed-pods (without utilising the 
           lawns or a portal) you have probably found "cheese". Please let me know how 
           you did it. -->
          </p>

          <!-- <p>
            The game is focussed around one core mechanic, that of collecting and throwing 
            seed-pods to build single-use bridges of lily-pads. Early chapters explore this 
            core mechanic in depth, avoiding edge-cases. 
            The first exploitable edge-case you discover is how to stack lily-pads and 
            make them flower. Stacking lily-pads makes them flower, which in turn yields 
            new seed-pods.
            This is the only way to recycle seed-pods and there is a natural loss of 
            resource in this cycle, so careful resource-management is core to many puzzles. 
            </p><p>
            Later chapters explore the many edge-cases that arise when collections of 
            things (lily-pads or seed-pods) hit five or more. There are several of these 
            edge-cases to discover and master. 
          </p> -->
