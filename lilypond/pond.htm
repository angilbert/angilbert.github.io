        <h2>Lily-pond</h2><p>
          Explore the serene world of the lily-pond and its surrounding water-gardens. 
          Tiptoe across the delicate lily-pads, gather seed-pods, grow new lily-pads and 
          discover how to harvest and recycle essential resources. In your travels keep a 
          lookout for the rare Andreana lily blooms that will unlock new gardens to explore.
          A route-finding, resource-management puzzle-game with a simple but 
          deep core mechanic.

            This puzzle concept was conceived late summer 2024 and remains in active development.
            To date (Sept 2025) there are seven chapters close to finalised and perhaps two more 
            in the pipe-line. When will this project be complete? I have no idea! But with a 
            site update long overdue, and no end in sight, it's high time to share some progress. 
            Thus here are the first five gardens.
            Please consider this a pre-release for play-testing. Feedback welcomed!

         <p><b>28/09/2025: V0.15:</b>
          <a href="https://mikanhako.itch.io">MikanHako</a> 
          kindly playtested V0.12, provided some great feedback and found a major bug!
          You can watch the full 
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zurl-Jv89sM">play-through</a> on YouTube. 
          V0.15 addresses the bug and clarifies the purpose of lawns (it is no longer 
          possible to re-enter the garden from the surrounding lawns, the lawns provide a 
          short-cut to the exit grotto only). Access to gardens 6/7 (which I hadn't 
          intended to publish) has also been removed.

          This game comes with minimal upfront information about the puzzle mechanics, 
          everything you need to know is discoverable as you play. If you would like some 
          extra guidance on the mechanics see the drop lists below. 
          For general guidance on how to navigate the puzzlescript UI see Q02 on the 
          <a href="../new-faq.htm">help</a> page.
        </p><p>
          Untypically (for a PS-app) this game offers both level-select and checkpoints 
          (within a level). The checkpoints offer you a localised restart, without having 
          to restart the whole level (if you want to restart a chapter afresh then use the 
          level-select menu). Checkpoints are currently invisible until you first reach them.

            <summary>Chapter 1: Mechanics and hints</summary>
            <p>
            Chapter 1 introduces the primary core mechanic; the ability to collect seed-pods 
            <i>in-hand</i> and throw them over water to grow temporary bridges of walkable 
            lily-pads. For Chapter 1 you only need concern yourself with mastering how to safely 
            navigate the water-garden optimising the use of the seed-pods you collect as you walk.
            Here is a list of the basic mechanics:
            </p>
            <p><ul>
              <li>Collect seed-pods by walking across the stepping-stones</li>
              <li>Throw seed-pods over water by stepping towards open water</li>
              <li>Seed-pods thrown across water grow new lily-pads</li>
              <li>You can walk across lily-pads but they sink as you walk across them</li>
              <li>Seed-pods that fall onto stepping-stones can be picked up again later</li>
              <li>Seed-pods that fall into the weeds instantly perish</li>
            </ul></p>
          </details>
          
          <details>
            <summary>Chapter 2: Mechanics and hints</summary>
            <p>
              Chapter 2 introduces several new facets of the core mechanic. The first is that 
              seed-pods can be found on water (collectable if reachable) the second is that two 
              or more lily-pads can co-exist in a stack, at the same location. The stack sinks 
              one lily-pad at a time making it strong enough to support multiple visits or 
              additional actions. 
              Stacked lily-pads grow a flower, one for each lily-pad in the stack. The flowers 
              are both a visual indicator of current height and a new element of the mechanic.
              As the stack shrinks the flowers die and in turn generate new seed-pods which 
              are only revealed once the last lily-pad sinks.
              So now you can start to recycle those seed-pods, how useful might that be?
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Chapter 3: Mechanics and hints</summary>
            <p>Chapter 3 builds on Chapter 2 offering trickier puzzles that require higher 
              stacks of lily-pad (indicated by more flowers). Here you will discover the extra 
              power or two, three or even more flowers. 
              Two flowers for example will permit three actions (step, pickup, throw) 
              without getting your feet wet, plus the bonus of two new seed-pods! 
              Stack carefully, in order to facilitate the right sequence of actions 
              including the option of harvesting the new seed-pods that are revealed as 
              you walk.  
            </p> 
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Chapter 4: Mechanics and hints</summary>
            <p>Chapter 4 introduces mud-banks. Mud-banks are an obstacle that blocks your path 
              but can also hold seed-pods. Seed-pods on mud can be collected by reaching 
              towards them, just like water-born seed-pods. It won't take long to discover 
              seed-pods can be thrown over mud enabling them to be scattered and regrouped 
              in powerful new ways. 
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Chapter 5: Mechanics and hints</summary>
            <p>Chapter 5 introduces the first <i>rule-of-five</i> edge-mechanic. 
              If you collect more than five seed-pods you immediately drop (i.e. <i>spill</i>) four 
              of them into adjacent locations. This mechanic may help or hinder progress
              but it definitely means you can never grow a row of six or more lily-pads 
              with a single throw, so how else might you achieve that? 
              Note that seed-pods that spill onto water grow a new lily-pad (as if thrown) and 
              seed-pods that spill into weeds instantly perish, so think careful where and 
              when to trigger this effect. 
              </p><p>
              You might well ask at this point... how have you managed to avoid spillage before?
              In earlier levels? It's a good question, and a puzzle in itself. A puzzle that 
              perhaps explains why it's taken me over a year to publish the first five chapters 
              of this game. 
          </p>
