          If you are unfamiliar with puzzlescript games then be prepared for a lack of instruction. The goal 
          and underlying mechanic are not always stated, they need to be discovered. In this instance however the 
          unknowns should reveal themselves pretty quickly. Just go explore...

            This puzzle concept was conceived in July 2022 after discovering the theme of 
            <a href="https://itch.io/jam/thinky-puzzle-game-jam-2">Thinky Puzzle Game Jam No.2</a>. 
            It became very clear, very quickly, that I was never going to hit the submission 
            dead-line but I liked the idea too much to abandon it. In the end it turned 
            into an all-consuming project, thanks to a decision to implement 
            it in an unfamiliar fork of puzzlescript called 
            <a href="https://github.com/ClementSparrow/Pattern-Script/wiki">Pattern:Script</a> (P:S)
            maintained by <a href="https://clement-sparrow.itch.io">Clement Sparrow</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            P:S was chosen in this instance because I realised it would vastly 
            reduce the overall code size. To illustrate just one aspect of the
            reduction, the 30 lines of code on the right suffices for defining 16 different 
            9x9 graphical sprites (one for each of the four decorated hats in each of its 
            four possible orientations). And thus 300+ lines of sprite definitions collapsed 
            down to 30 lines. To explore the full source
            <a href="https://clementsparrow.github.io/Pattern-Script/src/editor.html?hack=b81a790a66fda61d8192888ca2da072d">

            So yes, this is sokoban... of sorts. Each pushable object (hat) has one open side that acts 
            as a portal linked to another hat. 
            The pusher is now a two-unit object which has two distinct states, horizontal and vertical. 
            Passing through the portal (pointy end first) is referred to as a hat-trick and
            hat-tricks are the only way to facilitate a change of orientation. 
            Thus, the state-space you can reach at any point in time depends on your current orientation, 
            the pushable objects around you and the accessible open hats. Several interesting 
            interactions can occur if you enter a hat where the exit path is partially blocked.
