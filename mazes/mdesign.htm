    An introduction to structured maze design</H2>

    <P><B>Ever wondered how to design your own mazes? Well here's
    how I designed some of my own, personal favourites. The <I>Drinks
    tokens</I>, <I>Duvet</I>, <I>Nine crossroads</I> and <I>Walk
    on walls</I> (see <A HREF="ixmaze.htm">Maze gallery</A>) all
    owe their existance to this process, which I began to develop
    in the mid 80s and still often return too, when in need of fresh
    inspiration. The variations on this theme are virtually limitless,
    and a carefully designed maze template will produce a multitude
    of good mazes. I have also experimented with hexagonal (isometric)
    variations on this theme, samples of which can be found in the
    <A HREF="../attic/ixattic.htm">Attic gallery</A>.</B></P>

    <P>Step 1: Using squared paper, or your favourite graphics software
    tool, design a small maze building-block that repeats well and
    leaves just a few gaps. See diagrams (a) and (b) below.</P>

    <P>Step 2: Close off the open-ends round the edge of the design
    following the flow of the design as much as possible. You can
    choose to dead-end some paths, or link them together in groups.
    A group of three or more creates a fixed junction in the maze.
    In diagram (c) I have chosen to link paths in strict pairs creating
    no dead-ends or junctions. Note that at this point you may choose
    to leave two open-ends as entry and exit points.</P>

    <P>&nbsp;</P>

    <P>Step 3: Finalise any further fixed sections of the maze, including
    start and finish points (if not already chosen). Again follow
    the flow of the design and use symmetry where possible. These
    fixed sections, like the outside edges, may include dead-ends
    and junctions. Diagram (d) for example, includes no dead-ends
    but several junctions.</P>

    ALIGN="BOTTOM"></CENTER></P>

    <P>Step 4: Now you have a maze template. See diagram (e). The
    next stage is to design a selection of <I>plugs </I>that can
    be used to fill the gaps (nodes). These plugs are the variable
    element of the maze, give it a degree of randomness and allow
    many mazes to be drawn from the same template. In this instance
    I have chosen four plugs which, as it happens, are all the same
    except for rotation. See diagram (f).</P>

    <P>Step 5: Take the template and experiment filling the open
    nodes with the chosen plugs until you have your final maze with
    a least one route from 'A' to 'B'. See diagram (g).</P>
