        <h2>Maze of Life - World domination</h2><p>
          One of the earliest yet most difficult challenges to date has
          been that of <i>world domination</i>. From an arbitrary start,
          such as Y-start, is it possible to clear the board leaving the
          blue-cell the last and only cell left alive?
          </p>

      <div class="std-flex-block">

          <p>
            World domination is possible, but it took a computer search
            to prove it, find out more below. Alternatively discover world
            domination for yourself using this mini-challenge.</p>

        <h4>Findings</h4>
        <p>For many months world domination remained an unsolved challange,
          but in March 2001 Jacco Compier proved by computer search that
          world domination was possible, in as little as 15 moves. A convincing
          vindication that world domination is probably possible from almost
          any start-state that the blue-cell can 'escape' from. Here is
          a selection of the shortest known solutions for world-domination
          from Y-start. <b>x,y</b> indicates the final resting place of
          the blue-cell.</p>

          <div class="table-block">
            <table class="std-table">
            <tr> 
              <th>Solution</th> 
              <th>Length</th> 
              <th>x,y</th> 
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>USS\D\UD/SSS&gt;SD</td>
              <td>15</td> <td>4,3</td> 
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>SS&lt;U&lt;D&gt;U&lt;SSSU/D&gt;\UD</td>
              <td>19</td> <td>3,6</td> 
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>SS&lt;U&lt;DS/D/&lt;/S&lt;UL\/R</td>
              <td>19</td> <td>3,3</td> 
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>SS&lt;U&lt;DURSLSRS//D\&gt;D</td>
              <td>19</td> <td>5,5</td> 
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>SS&lt;U&lt;DURURRD\URR/SL</td>
              <td>19</td> <td>6,2</td> 
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>SS&lt;U&lt;DURUR/&lt;LS&gt;\SD</td>
              <td>18</td> <td>3,5</td> 
            </tr>
            </table>
          </div>
        <p>And here are some slightly longer solutions that all end with
          the blue-cell back in the centre (4,4).</p>
      
          <p>SS&lt;U&lt;D&gt;US&gt;/UL\SUSD&lt;/&gt;U<br>
          SS&lt;U&lt;D&gt;/D\/SSLD\&gt;/\&lt;/R<br>
          SS&lt;U&lt;DU&gt;&gt;SUULSSS\RRLR</p>

        <p>All these solutions are of course edge-dependent, which is
          true for many of the challenges posed and solved so far, but
          having proved world-domination is possible in as few as 15 moves,
          it is particularly tempting to ask... is world-domination also
          possible on an infinite board? And if so, what is the minimum
          size board?</p>
      
          <p>We have shown it is possible for the blue-cell to manouvre
          itself into the tiniest one-cell state, but one-cell is never
          going to survive by itself. What is the smallest, indefinitely
          survivable, state for the blue-cell? Is it those two 4-cell 
          stable-states
          <a href="./new-stable-early.htm">4a and 4b</a> we've already seen?
          No. If the blue-cell is prepared to retire to an oscillator,
          rather than a stable-state, the minimum is actually 3 cells.
          If you a familiar with Game of Life, you probably know the 3-cell,
          2-step, oscillator I refer too, but can the blue-cell retire
          to it from Y-start? I feel sure the answer is yes - but I do
          not know the shortest solution.</p>
      
          <p>Carl Hoff stumbled on several oscillators in his early search
          for stable-states and we began to collect examples of a brand
          new type of oscillator which is unique to intelligent-cell life.

          oscillators</a>.
