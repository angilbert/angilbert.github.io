        <h2>Maze of Life - Stable state goals</h2><p>
          The <a href="new-ystart.htm">Y-start challenge</a> introduced
          the idea of using stable-state cell arrangements as an alternative
          goal for Maze of Life. As goals go, the stable-states are certainly
          a rather more appropriate (life-orientated) choice. The inevitable
          question then arises... just how many stable-states can the blue-cell
          manufacture from an arbitrary start state, such as Y-start?

          <h4>Mini challenge</h4>
          <p>It turns out that the blue-cell is really quite good at generating
            stables-states. The stable-state goal illustrated on the right is
            reachable in 4 moves from Y-start. </p>
            <p>Discover a stable-state goal for yourself with this mini-challenge:</p>

              <b>From</b>: Y-start<br>
              <b>After</b>: SS&lt;U&lt;D&gt;US/RS&gt;/S<br>
              <b>Find</b>: a 14 cell stable-state (edge-dependent) 
                goal in 4 moves<br>

        <h4>Findings</h4>
        <p>Carl Hoff illustrated early on that a good number of stables-states
        are indeed reachable from Y-start. An early collection can be
        seen <a href="new-stable-early.htm">here</a>. It includes stable-state
        goals with 4 through 12 cells 
        (some free-standing, some edge-dependent)
        along with several multi-cluster arrangements. However, due to
        the limitations of the early V2 applet it was not easy to save
        and load move sequences and some were lost along the way, so
        for almost a year the collection included a number of <i>lost
        goals</i>. Eventually in March 2001 the gaps were filled by a
        Delphi search program written by Jacco Compier. Jacco's search
        program rapidly proved that our hand-crafted collection of goals
        was only a tiny subset of possible state-states reachable from
        Y-start. The move sequences of all stables-states reached in
        20 moves or less is listed <a href="solnj.txt">here</a>.</p>

        <p>One of the findings that came out of the early manual searches
        was that it was really quite easy to drop into a stable-state
        almost by accident, and often this was bad news for the blue-cell.
        Effectively the stable-states fall into two catagories, the <i>escapable</i>
        and the <i>inescapable</i>. Inescapable stable-states are another
        sort of dead-end. In effect the blue-cell doesn't have to die
        in Maze of Life, it may simply be forced to <i>retire</i>, infact
        Ed Pegg referred to all such states as <i>retirement-homes</i>.</p>

        <p>It is worth noting that Jacco's list of stables-states 
        (<a href="solnj.txt">from Y-start in 20 moves</a>) includes very
        few high-order stable-states, only 5 results with 20 or more
        cells. Carl Hoff once asked...&quot;How many live cells can you
        put in a stable state on the board at once? I can put 30. Now
        require it be non-edge based. I can put 24. My gut tells me that
        24 is the max in this case. Note if you could put 25 then the
        density of live cells would be above 50% and I think you can
        prove you can't do that on an infinite board. I'm not sure if
        30 is the max in the other case or not&quot;. Is Carl right?
        Find out more on the <a href="new-dense.htm">Dense goals</a>
        page.</p>

        <p>Some remaining questions relating to stable-states:</p>
        <p>Are <i>all</i> stable-state goals reachable from Y-start?<br>
        If yes... is it provable, and is this true for any size board?<br>
        If not... would another start do better?</p>

        <p>Another way of looking at these question is to ask... given
        the global set of Life stable-states is it possible for the blue-cell
        to manufacture any stable-state from at least one other stable-state?
        Ie. is the behaviour of the blue-cell sufficiently powerful to
        create a connected tree of all stable-states?</p>
