        <h2>Maze of Life - Active oscillators</h2><p>
          A wonderful new feature of Intelligent-cell Life (ILife) is the
        <i>active-oscillator </i>(or <i>flipper</i>). Similar to standard
        Life oscillators, an active oscillator is a sequence of steps
        that creates a cycle by returning to the start-state, but here
        the blue-cell plays an active role.
          </p>
      </div>
      <div><p>
        Active oscillators are not so hard to come by, but a 7x7 play-area
        is rather limiting, and searching for them methodically really
        requires a specialised search program (as yet untackled). Yet
        Jacco's stable-state search program did uncover many more for
        the collection and, inparticular began, to find some higher-order
        (3+) oscillators. Find out more below or discover your own 3-step
        active-oscillator using the following mini-challenge.

        <h4>Findings</h4>
        <p>Here are some early examples of 2-step active oscillators
          (flippers) discovered by hand. All these simple oscillators consist
          of two states that are mirror images of each other. The red arrow
          indicates the required movement of the blue-cell.</p>
      
          <p><img src="lifgf.gif" width="470"></p>
      
          <p>Solution strings for many more active-oscillators are listed
          <b><a href="solno.txt">here</a></b>, and the best of them are
          illustrated below in demo form. Just click on a link to try one.
          Each demo is pre-loaded with exactly two repeats of the oscillation,
          just use undo/redo to explore the cycle.</p>
      
          <ul>
            <li>Firstly 
              <a href="new-egp2y.htm">the Y-start active oscillator</a>
              - one of the simplest (see f3 above).
            <li>And how about 
              <a href="new-egp22ye.htm">return-to-Y</a>?
              You can do it in 22 moves. <br>
              (effectively a 22-step oscillator,
              although this sequence is 7x7 (edge) dependent).
            <li>Here's three more examples of nice two step oscillators:
              <a href="new-egp2n1.htm">No.1</a> - 
              <a href="new-egp2n2.htm">No.2</a> - 
              <a href="new-egp2n3.htm">No.3</a>
            <li>Here's an interesting 
              <a href="new-egp4e.htm">4-step oscillator</a> 
              (edge-dependent).
            <li>And here's a way to make it 
              <a href="new-egp4n.htm">non-edge dependent</a>.
            <li>Here are three 3-step oscillators: 
              <a href="new-egp3n1.htm">No.1</a> - 
              <a href="new-egp3n2.htm">No.2</a> - 
              <a href="new-egp3n3.htm">No.3</a>
            <li>Finally a 
              <a href="new-egp6n.htm">higher-order (6-step) 
                non-edge based oscillator</a>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Note that in the last case the blue-cell is stationary for
          4 out of 6 moves (SSLSSR), but it is still an <i>active</i> oscillator
          since it only takes one move of the blue-cell to break the normal
          life sequence and create something new. If the blue-cell doesn't
          move <i>at all</i>, then you have a traditional Life oscillator.
          Interestingly not all traditional life oscillators are supported
          in ILife, I believe the general rule is that ILife can only mimic
          traditional oscillators if the oscillator contains a permanent
          (stator) cell which can contain the blue-cell for the duration
          of the complete cycle. If the blue-cell has to move, its transient
          nature will destroy the normal oscillator pattern.</p>
      
          <p>The majority of high-order oscillators found so far are still
          edge-dependent and I am keen to find more to add to the collection.
          So if you find one, let me know. It is quite fun to try crafting
          them by hand (which is how I found 
          <a href="new-egp4n.htm">this one</a>) 
          but I recommend you use a larger grid, such as 
          <a href="new-life15.htm">15x15</a>.</p>
      
          <p>So, we have shown the blue-cell can turn itself into simple
          (and not so simple) oscillators, but can it control its environment
          in more exotic way, say by moving around its environment and
          spawning isolated colonies of traditional life-forms in its path?
          To find out just how powerful the blue-cell can be read on...
