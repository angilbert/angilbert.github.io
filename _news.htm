    Lots of stuff new this month, see my <B><A HREF="_history.htm">history
    page</A></B> for full details. I also want to mention two recent
    discoveries; if you are in the UK and enjoy <B><A HREF="http://www02.so-net.ne.jp/~kajitani/cgi-bin/pbn.cgi/index.html">Paint
    by Number</A></B> puzzles keep an eye out for the new monthly
    magazine <I>Tsunami Japanese puzzles</I>. I stumbled on copies
    in ASDA and Sainsburys, very addicitive. Also checkout the interesting
    new <I>SpectraMazes</I> at <B><A HREF="http://www.gambitgameworks.com/introduction.htm">Gambit

    This month I congratulate David Newstead Bishop for discovering
    that at least one of my <B><A HREF="newtile/ixtile.htm">Tile
    puzzles</A></B> does not have a unique solution (this month I
    publish all known solutions). I also feature my latest plank-puzzle
    <B><A HREF="planks/no15.htm">Fiendish</A></B> [No.15]. Also this
    month I can recommend some great new web-based multi-state mazes:
    Robert Abbott's <B><A HREF="http://www.logicmazes.com/alice.html">Alice
    Mazes</A></B> (Java-script), along with Joker's <B><A HREF="http://www.joker-games.com/Rah.html">Maze
    of Rah</A></B> (Java).<p></P>

    <P><HR ALIGN=LEFT><FONT CLASS="note"><B>May 2001:</B></FONT>
<BR>
    Significant updates to <B><A HREF="life/ixlife.htm">Maze of Life</A></B>
    and <B><A HREF="planks/ixplanks.htm">Plank puzzles</A></B> plus
    a new page that explores <B><A HREF="fourbit/ix4bit.htm">Oskar's
    Four-bit mazes</A></B>. Several photos of other mechanical puzzles
    designed by Oskar added to older pages. Also this month I congratulate
    Thomas Kelby (age 12) from Luton, for solving <I>all four</I>
    <B><A HREF="newtile/ixtile.htm">Tile puzzles</A></B> from a standing
    start in less than an hour. I can vouch for this, because I watched
    him do it!<p></P>

    <P><HR ALIGN=LEFT><FONT CLASS="note"><B>Sept 2001:</B></FONT>

    This month I am delighted to introduce two recent applets by
    Graham. Firstly <B><A HREF="http://www.henleymob.co.uk/fliptile/index.html">FlipTiles</A></B>
    (inspired by Joker's <B><A HREF="http://www.joker-games.com/Rah.html">Maze
    of Rah</A></B>). Sixteen puzzles so far, more may follow. Secondly
    <B><A HREF="spin/ixspin.htm">HexaRoll</A></B>, an implementation
    of a head-spinning puzzle idea by Oskar, including a couple of
    extra designs of my own. In summer 2001 one of my tilt-maze designs
    was used as a walk-round maze in the US, Robert Abbott provides
    a <B><A HREF="http://www.logicmazes.com/">photo and write-up</A></B>.
    Finally, for <B><A HREF="http://www.zillions-of-games.com/">Zillions-Of-Games</A></B>

    This month I introduce some great new material provided by my
    visitors. Firstly from Dr William Pauslen there is some extensive
    new <B><A HREF="life/ixlife.htm">maze of life</A></B> (iLife)
    analysis, see <B><A HREF="life/_glide.htm">riding the glider</A></B>.

    HREF="planks/ixplanks.htm">plank puzzles</A></B> generated by
    his java-driven <B><A HREF="planks/beast.htm">SwampBeast</A></B>.
    On the subject of <B><A HREF="newtilt/ixtilt2d.htm">2D tilt mazes</A></B>
    Bill has provided a page of design notes on his <B><A HREF="newtilt/billtilt.htm">tilt
    maze console</A></B>, and for Mac OSX users Kevin Brain has included
    some of my tilt maze designs in his downloadable <B><A HREF="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/games/puzzlebox.html">PuzzleBox</A></B>
    games pack. As for me, I have spent many happy hours designing
    <B><A HREF="cups/ixcups.htm">cup and pea puzzles</A></B> an accidental
    new form of tilt-puzzle (applet by Graham at <B><A HREF="http://www.henleymob.co.uk/">henleymob</A></B>).<p></P>

    festive!<p></P>

    <P><HR ALIGN=LEFT><FONT CLASS="note"><B>Feb 2003:</B></FONT>
<BR>
    This month introduces a new series of puzzles called <B><A HREF="../www24/boxup/ixboxup.htm">BoxUp</A></B>,
    something akin to Sokoban but where you can only push boxes from
    the inside. Also this month clickmazes is pleased to help promote
    a new website called <B><A HREF="http://www.megamazes.com/?s=CM">MegaMazes</A></B>
    offering high-quality mazes for view, download and print. Check

        New this month is the <b><a href="quantum/ixquantum.htm">Quantum maze</a></b> 
        by Jonathan Welton (UK). Poor old Schr&ouml;dinger's cat needs your help! 
        Open up the box and help him escape ... but beware, the quantum maze will 
        collapse around you at every step. How many universes will you burn through 
        to find the one route to safety? Also this month I offer a tantalising 
        glimpse of a brand-new collection of computer-generated <b> <a href="tjwrig/ixbhwrig.htm">Extreme

        thought for a moment ... just two moving objects on a 4x4 grid - how hard 
        can that be? These puzzles truly reset the bar for puzzle complexity on 
        a small grid.</p>
