        <h2>Fliptiles 2001-2024</h2><p>
          Fliptiles is a simplified derivative of the fabulous 
          sokoban/logicmaze hybrid puzzle-game 
          <a href="http://www.joker-games.com/Rah.html">Maze of Rah</a> 
          by <a href="http://www.joker-games.com">Marco Brenco</a>.
          This page tells the story of how a ground-breaking 3D/animated applet 
          from 2001 ultimately helped in the final stages of adding canvas 
          sprite support to PSNext (2024). Successfully demonstrating a PS app 
          could now closely emulate my beloved java.awt.Graphics2D based applet.

          The original <a href="http://www.joker-games.com/Rah.html">Maze of Rah</a> 
          applet was built in December 2000 and first published online in 2001. 
          At that time this easily stood out as the most advanced applet-based 
          puzzle-game I'd ever seen. If you don't have a suitable browser plugin 
          installed to play the applet online, you can instead watch a

          The innovative sokoban/logicmaze hybrid mechanics in Maze of Rah 
          had me instantly hooked, in particular the logicmaze potential of the 
          flippable path tiles. Back in 2001 I was very keen to start exploring 
          my own level designs. Thankfully I didn't have to wait long.

          Hot on its heels, came the fliptile applet demake by 
          Graham Rogers (2001) supplemented soon after by a stand-alone 
          java app (makeflips) that I could run offline to design my own 
          levels. 
          The java.awt.Graphics2D based UI was very typical of the simple 
          puzzle apps that the two of us were producing at that time. 
          Those java applet paint() methods could be quickly hacked 
          together, cribbed from previous applets.

          Fast forward to 2021... a refresh for modern browsers is overdue. 
          Graham set his sights on a native JS/HTML5 app, but puzzlescript 
          was now my tool of choice and the ruleset was a natural fit. 
          That year, we both ended up reworking that old fliptile concept. 
          Graham's <a href="http://www.henleymob.co.uk/JSGames/fliptile/fliptile.html">
          JS/HTML5 port</a> arrived first, the graphics being a simple
          java-to-JS migration. 
          My <a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=6a2c895c46e8f98259f8241eb54d3c7c">
          vanilla PS hack</a> arrived later, its cute 5x5 pixel sprites 
          a masterpiece in re-design (albeit unintelligible).       
          Now I could edit/test/play/solve new levels at top speed. 
          <a href="http://www.henleymob.co.uk">Henleymob</a>
          was duly updated with a fresh crop of puzzles. Job done.

          2021 could have been the end of the story. My cryptic PS hack 
          tucked away in an unpublished GIST, lacking further useful purpose.
          But in early 2024 canvas support in PSNext arrived, along with it
          the potential for some realistic java.awt.Graphics2D emulation. 
          To fully exercise it all I needed was a working PS ruleset in need 
          of a graphical overhaul. That old PS hack was the perfect candidate
          for the first
