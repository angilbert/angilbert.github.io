        <h2>Microchip fractal mazes (2024 collection)</h2>
        <p>
          This page offers a selection of fractal mazes inspired by the works of Mark J. P. Wolf (2003) 
          and Ed Pegg Jr (2011). The collection starts with four hand-crafted mazes first published in 
          early 2021, now ported to PS+ and updated for faster game play. 
          The new set of designs for 2024 have been derived from computer-generated data provided by 
          Erich Friedman in late 2021, adapted to demonstrate a variety of fractal maze-forms related 
          to Ed Pegg's Wolfram maze.

        <p>Use cursor-keys to move the spark along the wires, the spark will keep moving until it 
          reaches a new goal or a decision point. Goals are indicated by orange squares and 
          only exist on the home-level of the maze. Use ESC for level select.</p>

        <h4>Development notes - History</h4>

          The Wolfram maze (2011) pictured here on the right is an 8-pin maze in 
          a 22222/33 configuration. Meaning... of the 16 edge connectors (8 inner 
          / 8 outer), 10 are connected as 5 pairs and the remaining 6 are connected 
          in 2 pairs of 3, forming the only two decision points. These two 
          decision nodes can be seen connected to pins 4 and 5 in the illustration. 
        </p><p>
          In 2011 I was intrigued by the depth of the recursion required to solve 
          such a minimal fractal design, and wondered if more could be achieved 
          with other pin configurations (such as 22/3333).
          I also noted that if I could only recurse outward from the start point I 
          could reach the goal in a single move, what if bi-directional recursion 
          was permitted?
         </p><p>
          In 2021 I eventually started exploring some bi-directional Wolfram-style mazes 
          of my own. I implemented them in rudimentary puzzlescript, and shared them at 
          itch.io. Later the same year Erich Friedman started exploring other 
          configurations of 8 and 9 pin mazes, specifically configurations 
          22222/33 (8-pin) through to 333333 (9-pin), with most effort directed at the 
          22/3333 configuration. 
          The data taught me a lot about what was and wasn't possible with single-chip 
          fractal mazes, ultimately provoking me to comment (in an email in 
          Jan 2022) that fractal mazes are <q>endlessly fascinating in their ultimate 
          dullness!</q>. It took two years to find the enthusiasm to revisit the data 
          and finalise a set of new mazes. 
          </p>

        <h4>Development notes - Implementation</h4>

        <p>Puzzlescript is an ideal engine for implementing many grid-based logic-mazes, 
          however for fractal mazes it poses a few challenges. With no stack, and only 
          primitive mechanisms for counting how do you implement a potentially infinite 
          recursive maze? The short answer is... with some difficulty.
          Setting a generous but finite recursion limit avoids one set of problems, 
          but if a fractal shape can contain multiple copies of itself, then it is very
          difficult to track current state without a stack. As it happens I was happy 
          to side-step the latter problem completely, because I was focussed on
          bi-directional recursion. Each fractal chip had to be unique and contain
          a maximum of one copy of itself (or another chip) so that recursing upwards 
          is never ambiguous. 
          </p>

          <h4>Development notes - clickmazes variations</h4>

          <p>As mentioned above, one key benefit of non-repetition of the fractal 
          shape is that it supports unambiguous bi-directional recursion, thus all mazes 
          featured here allow you to explore in both directions. But without fractal 
          repetition what variations on the traditional Wolfram maze are actually possible? 
          </p><p>
          One idea explored here is to make the mazes multi-goal (by placing a 
          separate target on every home-level path). Other ideas involve redistributing 
          the available microchip "pins" to form dual-chip and split-chip mazes.
          Dual-chip mazes consists of two non-identical chips each containing a 
          copy of the other (to break parity direct connections between the dual-chips
          are also permitted). 
          Split-chip is a further variation where the outer edge of the fractal 
          chip is an amalgamation of several non-identical inner chips. So 4 inner 
          chips, each with 3 outbound termini, yields an outer chip with 12 inbound 
          termini. These fractal mazes start to feel a little "cursed" but are they
          fundamentally harder? Let me know if you decide.
