        <h2>Microchip fractal mazes (2024 collection)</h2>
        <p>
          This page offers a selection of fractal mazes inspired by the works of Mark J. P. Wolf (2003) 
          and Ed Pegg Jr (2011). The collection starts with four hand-crafted mazes first published in 
          early 2021, now ported to PS+ and updated for faster game play. 
          The new set of designs for 2024 have been derived from computer-generated data provided by 
          Erich Friedman in late 2021, adapted to demonstrate a variety of new fractal maze-forms.

        <p>Use cursor-keys to move the spark along the wires, the spark will keep moving until it 
          reaches an unvisited goal or a decision point. Goals are indicated by orange squares and 
          can only be harvested on the home-level of the maze. Use ESC for level select.</p>

        <h4>Development notes - History</h4>

        <p>The Wolfram maze (2011) is an 8-pin maze, in a 22222/33 configuration. The 8 
          edge-connectors (pins) offer 8 inner (downward) and 8 outer (upward) termini. 
          Of the 16 termini, 2 sets of 3 are connected to form the two decision points. 
          The other 10 termini are plumbed in 5 pairs with no decision points.
          In 2011 I was intrigued by the depth of the recursion required to solve 
          such a minimal fractal design, but I also noted that if I could only
          recurse outward from the start point I could reach the goal in a single move. 
         </p>
          <p>
          In 2021 I eventually started exploring some bi-directional Wolfram-style mazes 
          of my own. I implemented them in rudimentary puzzlescript, and shared them at 
          itch.io. Later the same year Erich Friedman kindly started exploring other 
          configurations of 8 and 9 pin mazes, specifically configurations 22222/33 (8-pin) 
          through to 333333 (9-pin) with most effort spent on 22/3333 (8-pin). 
          The data taught me a lot about what was and wasn't possible with single-chip 
          fractal mazes. Ultimately provoking me to comment (in an email in 
          Jan 2022) that fractal mazes are <q>endlessly fascinating in their ultimate 
          dullness!</q>. I needed to take a breather.  
          In Jan 2024 the dullness finally dissipated and I was tempted to take 
          another look at Erich's data, resulting in this, the 2024 collection. 
          </p>

        <h4>Development notes - Implementation</h4>

        <p>Puzzlescript is an ideal engine for implementing many grid-based logic-mazes, 
          however for fractal mazes it poses a few challenges. With no stack, and only 
          primitive mechanisms for counting how do you implement a potentially infinite 
          recursive maze? The short answer is... you don't.
          Setting a generous (but finite) recursion limit avoids one set of problems, 
          but if a fractal shape can contain multiple copies of itself, then it is very
          difficult to track current state without a stack. So to keep things simple 
          I decided to side-step the latter problem completely. Each 
          fractal chip is unique and contains a maximum of one copy of itself (or 
          another chip) following closely the simple model of the Wolfram maze.</p>

          <h4>Development notes - clickmazes variations</h4>

          <p>One key benefit of non-repetition of the fractal shape is there is no 
          ambiguity with recursing "upwards" from the start level, thus all mazes 
          featured here allow you to explore in both directions. But given this 
          restriction what other variations on the fractal maze are possible? Most of
          the more complex fractal mazes you find online rely on repetition of 
          the same fractal shape within itself. 
          My first idea was to make the mazes multi-goal (by placing a separate 
          target on every home-level path). Then to start redistributing the 
          available microchip "pins" to form dual-chip and split-chip mazes.
          Dual-chip mazes consists of two non-identical chips each containing a 
          copy of the other (to break parity direct connections between the dual-chips
          are also permitted). 
          Split-chip is a further variation where the outer edge of the fractal 
          chip is an amalgamation of several non-identical inner chips. So 4 inner 
          chips, each with 3 outbound termini, yields an outer chip with 12 inbound 
          termini. These fractal mazes start to feel a little "cursed" but are they
          fundamentally harder? Let me know if you decide.
