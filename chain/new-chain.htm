        <h2>Chain Reaction</h2><p>
          Cross off all the symbols and clear the board. The
          challenge is to form a single continuous chain that visits every
          symbol once and once only and where each link in the chain connects
          two symbols that match either by shape or colour. You can leap
          around the board, but not diagonally.

          There are several pre-canned puzzles to try of increasing
          difficulty. You can also auto-generate new puzzles using any
          one of the pre-canned puzzles as a 'seed'. Just select your puzzle
          and hit auto-generate. The resulting puzzle will be the same
          size and will have a similar distribution of symbols. Auto-generated
          puzzles are guaranteed to have between one and five solutions,
          depending on size (smaller puzzles have less) and tend to be
          a little easier than the pre-canned puzzles.</p>
          <p>Chain-reaction was inspired in part by Robert Abbott's 
        <a href="http://www.logicmazes.com/eyeball.html">eyeball
          mazes</a> which use a similar chaining rule.

            Cross off all the symbols by visiting them one a time ensuring
            each symbol matches the last either in shape or colour (or both).
            At each turn you can move horizontally or vertically any distance.
            The start position is marked with a cross but the finish square
            could be anywhere!</p>
          <h4>Controls</h4><p>
            Use the <b>Puzzle</b> drop-list to select a puzzle.<br>
            Use the <b>Restart </b>(Action) or hit <b>space</b> to reset
            the puzzle.<br>
            Use <b>Solve</b> (Action) to sneak a peak at the solution<br>
            Use <b>Auto-generate</b> to try a random puzzle (if the auto-generator
            is still busy - wait a few seconds and try again).</p>
          <h4>Movement</h4><p>
            Click on grid to move.
