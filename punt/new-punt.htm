        <h2>Punt mazes</h2><p>
          These little puzzles can be 
          viewed as a particularly mean variation on sokoban. As in 
          sokoban the target is to push objects (in this case punt-discs
          or <i>pucks</i>) around a maze to cover various targets. In a punt
          maze however the pusher slides forward tilt-style until it hits
          an obstacle, and a puck that gets struck will be punted forward
          a matching distance.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>The grey walls are a solid barrier to the green pusher
          but are no obstacle to a yellow puck. You can punt a puck through 
          a wall or over and past another puck provided it comes to rest in 
          a clear space. Punting a puck out of play 
          (including onto a wall) is not permitted.

          <h4>Aim</h4><p>
            Use the green cross as a pusher to 'punt' the yellow 
            pucks onto their black targets.</p>
          <h4>Movement</h4><p>
            The green pusher will run in a straight line until it hits
            a wall or a yellow puck. If it hits a puck the puck 
            will be punted forward a matching distance.

        <h3>Puzzle history</h3>
        <p>
          The punt mazes were originally featured on the
          <a href="http://www.greylabyrinth.com/discussion/">
          greylabyrinth</a> discussion forum, in March 2005. 
          They were conceived by forum member <i>mathgrant</i> and 
          implemented in JS by <i>ralphmerridew</i>. The original 
          implementation is now lost in the labyrinthine 
          tunnels of the internet itself, but lost does not mean 
          forgotten.
          </p><p>
          In 2018 the original puzzle designs were rediscovered 
          by itch.io developer <a href="https://chz.itch.io">CHz</a>
          and resurrected in glorious 
          <a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net">puzzlescript</a>.
          And so finally, as of January 2021, this page could be
          reborn.
        </p><p>
          Rediscovered more recently there is also 
          <a href="https://www.mansoft.nl/svg/punt/punt.html">Punt (SVG)</a>
          which is a native SVG port by Henri Manson.</p>
        <p>As a miscellaneous footnote, it should be stated I can 
          no longer solve these puzzles.</p>
