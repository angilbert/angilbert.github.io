    The tilt maze console</H2>

    <P>This device is a battery-operated, gravity driven implementation
    of Andrea&#146;s tilt puzzles. As it is tilted, mercury switches
    detect the tilt and, on a matrix of 10x10 cells, LEDs appear
    to &quot;roll&quot; from cell to cell exactly as they would do
    under gravity and according to the rules of Andrea&#146;s tilt
    puzzles. The package measures approximately 17cm by 10cm by 4cm.</P>

    <P>The LED matrix is overlaid with a grid printed on transparent
    film, allowing walls to be positioned through which rolling LEDs
    cannot pass. The layout of the grid is communicated via a user
    keypad by typing a code number printed on the overlay. The unit
    can be pre-programmed with details of up to 100 of these grids,
    and a further 5 grids can be defined and saved using interactive
    puzzle editors, also operated via the keypad.</P>

    <P>In addition to the LEDs that represent rolling balls, one
    or more additional flashing LEDs, representing &quot;targets&quot;,
    may be present. These targets do not move when the device is
    tilted, they remain in the same place. If however a ball rolls
    over a target, the target is extinguished. The grid may also
    have one or more cells marked so as to indicate the presence
    of a &quot;hole&quot;. When an LED rolls over such a hole, it
    disappears from play. An internal sounder provides audible feedback
    by clicking as the LEDs&#146; roll from cell to cell, and bleeping
    and chirping as targets are extinguished.</P>

    <P>The usual objective is simply to extinguish all targets, but
    puzzles with alternative objectives are equally possible, such
    as extinguishing all &quot;rollers&quot; by dropping them through
    holes.</P>

    <P>&nbsp;</P>

    <P><B>For the technically curious..</B>.</P>

    <P>Internally, the device is comprised of a 4MHz PIC microcontroller
    which contains 8K words of flash PROM and 368 bytes of RAM. The
    100 LEDs are organised as a multiplex of 4 columns of 25 rows.
    The 4 columns are strobed in software by a 2mS clock, providing
    a complete repaint every 8mS, equivalent to a 125Hz refresh so
    there is no visible flicker. The four mercury switches and the
    the 4x3 keypad combined to form a single 4x4 matrix, polled by
    the CPU.</P>

    <P>Battery life was obviously a major design consideration. Powered
    by four alkaline AAs, it has been found that in practice typically
    15-20 hours play is possible without any noticeable deterioration
    in brightness, and up to 40 hours before the LEDs become excessively
    dim. For simplicity of operation, and to avoid the use of potentially
    unreliable cheap mechanical switches, switching On and Off is
    performed via keypad sequences. When &quot;off&quot;, the PIC
    is actually placed in low-power sleep mode, drawing only a few
    microamps, presenting a drain which is negligible compared to
    the batteries shelf-life.</P>

    <P>I experimented with the possibility of using the LED matrix
    to provide scrolling text for user messages, with a custom character
    generator tailored to the 10x10 display. This was not particularly
    successful as it turned out to be a bit like trying to read a
    newspaper through a microscope!  From longer distances (10 to
    30 feet), the scrolling text was highly legible despite the limited
    display size. I have not developed this aspect any further other
    than to add a novelty feature - you can turn the unit on either
    side, or upside down, and a scrolling banner reading &quot;Roll-Play,
    from clickmazes.com...&quot; automatically self-rights itself
    and so always reads horizontally.</P>

    <P>Further development, if I can ever find the time, may centre
    around some kind of animated display on the LEDs, accompanied
    by appropriate bleeps and jingles, to provide the &quot;reward&quot;
    when a puzzle is solved.</P>
