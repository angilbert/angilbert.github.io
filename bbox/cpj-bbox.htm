        <H2>BlackBox</H2><p>
        Blackbox is a two-player deductive game invented
        by <A HREF="http://www.ericsolomon.co.uk/">Eric Solomon</A> in the 1970s. 
        Your goal is to discover the whereabouts of five atoms in a black box by sending 
        rays of light into the box and observing if and where the rays emerge. An atom 
        will either absorb a ray if the ray hits it head on, or deflect a ray through 90&deg;
        if it comes close (passes through an adjacent row or column). Two deflections can 
        occur at the same time forcing a ray to return and emerge at its entry point, this 
        is referred to as reflection.</p>
      </div>
      <div><p>
        The challenge is to pin point the location of all atoms using the least number of rays. 
        If you wish to commit your solution and to discover your score you must have 
        <B>exactly</B> five guesses marked, then click on <B>Reveal</B>. The five hidden
        atoms will appear marked as <B>@</B></p>

          <H4>Scoring</H4><p>
            Your score will be 36 (the total number of ray buttons) minus the number of ray buttons 
            used, minus 5 for each incorrect guess. Any score in <B>double figures</B> is good!

          The diagram below illustrates how rays sent into the box interact with the atoms. 
          Absorbed rays are labelled <B>A</B>. Reflected rays are labelled <B>R</B> 
          (note that the two types of reflection, brown and green, are indistinguishable). 
          Rays which propagate through the box from one point to another, as with the red ray,
          have their entry and exit points marked with a unique number.
          Note that rays may be deflected several times before emerging from the box, or 
          before being absorbed or reflected.</p>
