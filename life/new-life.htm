        <h2>Maze of Life &#9749;</h2><p>
          The puzzles on this page and those that follow are based
          on the well known Game of Life algorithm invented by John Conway.
          This variation on standard Life was suggested to me by my father,
          James Gilbert, as an interesting basis for an interactive puzzle-maze.
          Ed Pegg (<a href="http://www.mathpuzzle.com/">www.mathpuzzle.com</a>)
          aptly christened the blue cell the <i>intelligent </i>cell.</p>
          <p>The basic idea is this; you have control over one cell, the
          blue cell. Your aim is to keep the blue cell alive and reach
          a predefined goal. At each moment in time the blue cell is permitted
          to move to any adjacent, empty cell, or may stay where it is.
          Traditional game-of-life rules apply, and if the blue cell dies
          it's game over.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Here first is the original Maze of Life puzzle-set (June 2000).
          The target here is for the blue cell to reach a nominated cell
          location, marked in red. Undo is provided, but to make things
          tricky is limited to one move only, so beware, you may get trapped
          and have to start over. Simple survival is relatively easy, just
          make sure you always pick a location that has either two or three
          live neighbours.

          <h4>Goal</h4><p>
            Navigate the blue cell to the red goal</p>
          <h4>Controls</h4><p>
            Click on <b>Restart</b> to load first puzzle or restart current
            puzzle.<br>
            Click on <b>Previous/Next</b> to switch between puzzles.<br>
            Click on <b>Undo</b> to undo last move (one move only).</p>
          <h4>Movement</h4><p>
            Click on the <b>grid</b> to move. 
            Note that, during normal play, once a move (click) has been
            accepted the blue cell will either die immediately or life will
            progress one instant. This allows you to clearly see why the
            blue cell died.</p>
            <h4>Keys</h4><p>
              <b>n</b> - next puzzle <br>
              <b>p</b> - previous puzzle<br>
              <b>r</b> - restart current puzzle<br>
              <b>u</b> - undo last move</p>

        <p>An extra challenge was initially suggested by 
        <a href="http://www.mathpuzzle.com/">Ed Pegg</a>: &quot;<i>One
          Life maze I'm been particularly intrigued by is Maze #2. I've
          been going from the starting position, to the goal, back to the
          start, back to the goal. That's where I've died a number of times.
          I'm thinking this might make a great little contest... one point
          for each trip... what is the maximum number of points you can
          get?&quot;</i>. Note that if you can complete a round trip and finish
          with the exact same cell-arrangement you started with then you
          have effectively proven that you must be able to loop indefinitely.
          In Sept 2003 Berend Jan van der Zwaag successfully cracked this 
          challenge! <a href="new-berend.htm">See solution</a>.</p>
          <p>If you enjoyed Maze of Life... read on, the following pages
          include many more challenges. I recommend you start with 
          <a href="new-ystart.htm">the Y-start challenge</a>. Alternatively,
          if you would like to discover just how creative the blue-cell
          can be, jump to
