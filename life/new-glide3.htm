        <h2>iLife - Optimal sequences</h2><p>
          This page was kindly provided by Dr William Paulsen of Arkansas
          State University in Jan 2003, it is a follow up to his earlier
          findings described under the heading 
          <a href="new-glide.htm">riding the glider</a>. 
          This page includes several optimal iLife
          sequences, including a sequence that builds a <i>Light
          Weight Space Ship</i>. Together these sequences provide the
          means of building glider guns much more efficiently than ever
          before. Knowledge of traditional Life terminology and glider-gun
          formation helps here, as does an understanding if the concept
          of iLife. For an introduction to iLife see the 
          <a href="new-life.htm">Maze of life V1</a> page.</p>
          <p>The rest of this page is in Dr Paulsen's own words, 
          click on any highlighted sequence to see a demonstration.

        First of all, I wanted to see
        which life-forms can easily be spawned the way that the blinker
        and glider were spawned. I decided to examine all combinations
        that could be produced in 20 moves, starting from the loaf position,
        which seems to act as a gateway.</p>
        <p>From a computer search I found there
        are 25466828 ways of traveling from the loaf position within
        20 moves. Of these, 13730 have the blue cell riding a glider,
        sometimes with other debris that could potentially spawn a life-form.
        I then went through the 13730 pictures and worked out which
        of these produced anything interesting (this was the time consuming
        part!). My work was rewarded with the following results.

              Forms a Light
              Weight Space Ship (LWSS) using 19 moves! This last example is
              the unique way of producing the LWSS in under 21 moves. It also
              provides a powerful tool as seen below.

      <div><p>
        Having the ability to launch LWSS as
        well as gliders is like having both rooks and bishops in chess:
        they can be used together to form complicated structures very
        quickly. To demonstrate, here is a sequence that produces a 
        <a href="new-gg2003d5.htm">glider gun in only 247 moves</a> 
        (starting from the EEN loaf):

        <tr><td>L/SUSU&lt;&lt;U&lt;D&gt;&gt;&gt;/RS&lt;R&gt;</td>
          <td>Creates a formation which is a pure glider generator. That is,
            it produces a glider with no debris after 63 moves. I call this
            a <i>fused glider</i> since it gives the blue cell time to
            produce a second, or even a third, glider which forms simultaneously.
            In this case it merely allows the completion of the glider gun
            early.

      <p>It is interesting that the LWSS needs
        to run into a bi-block to form a single glider going in the other
        direction. Ironically, I came very close to throwing out the
        &quot;pseudo-life&quot; formed during my exhaustive search, but
        decided to leave them in.
