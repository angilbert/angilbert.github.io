Here is a way of constructing the glider gun in 744 moves.  
I started by finding a more efficient way of forming a blinker 
(21 moves) which boards a glider instead of forming a loaf.  I 
also discovered a way to form a block and board a glider in 
only 17 moves!  These routines are clear in the following 
construction of the glider gun.

Start with the Y centered at (36,25).

                                             strikes 5 steps after
                                             the previous glider.

At this point, the glider gun will evolve, and we used --- 744 moves.
However, we are in the line of fire!  So there is one more thing to 
do:

</S>U>D<\DUR\DU\UR/L\\SS\SS\SS...             Get out of the way!

A few comments:

The biggest problem I encountered was parity.  If the grid was 
painted in a checkerboard pattern, I would find that my glider 
is on the wrong color to put a given object at a given location.
Luckily, whenever I rotated the glider, I could control the parity.
But since I wanted to avoid the extra steps of a rotation, I had to
form the still life in a different order than I first planed.

The second biggest problem was interferrence from the objects that
I already formed.  The original plan was to have the gun fire away
from the final position, but I had to flip the gun in order for the 
second blinker to be accessible.

The * shows a longer routine for rotating a glider.  However, this
routine puts the glider closer to where I wanted to go, so it 
ended up saving me 4 steps.  I discovered this savings by mistake --
there may be other similar places where several steps can be saved.
