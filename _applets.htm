        </B>This is an original home-grown puzzle, first published in
        the Lubenham Village Newsletter (circa 1982). One of it's most
        striking features is that it <B>isn't a maze</B>... not sure
        how that happened. The original 10-piece tile set (introduced
        December '97) was a new set, refined and tested to ensure only
        a single solution.</P>

        <P CLASS="table">Tile puzzle required reading several new chapters
        on Java, including (several times over) one particularly baffling
        section on how to control screen flicker. Image handling was
        an easier section, but unfortunately also turned out to be the
        wrong section, graphics handling would have been better since
        the initial version of tile puzzle used forty gif files and could
        be very slow to load. Tile puzzle was thus belatedly revamped
        in February '98 to draw it's own graphics.</P>

        <P CLASS="table">A range of four tile sets, one for all abilities,
        was introduced in April 98. The most time-consuming part of this
        development was deciding the color schemes.</P>

        I first experimented with mazes based on the knight's move more
        than a decade ago but this is the first to have a special moving
        'peep-hole' through which the maze is viewed. The peep-hole principle
        could be applied to any maze of course, but the knight's tour
        also offered a test-bed for some simple Java graphics.</P>

        <P CLASS="table">Implementing the knight's tour maze went remarkably
        smoothly (for a change), it actually took longer to come up with
        a satisfactory maze than write the Java. That said, I found <B>fillRect()</B>
        rather troublesome; is it meant to include or exclude the width

        The tilt mazes are a brand new form of interactive puzzle-maze,
        designed from scratch with Java and the web in mind. As a concept
        they are also my first new mazes for some years, for those who
        have asked me why I'm not producing mazes any more, well this
        I trust will be a new beginning. Perversely, the more complex
        3D tilt maze came first, it was only after implementation that
        I decided the tilt behaviour was sufficiently interesting in
        isolation to merit the development of a simple 2D version.</P>

        <P CLASS="table">The tilt mazes, as originally launched, required
        little or no new knowledge of Java. I had a little trouble initially
        getting the main panel (container) to redraw itself with a different
        set of components (yes, yes... <B>validate()</B> &#150; so obvious!?).
        It did take somewhat longer than a Sunday afternoon this time,
        but then so did the mazes.</P>

        <P CLASS="table">In April '98 the tilt mazes were significantly
        reworked to make use of the new base classes introduced by the
        tilt puzzles (see below).</P>

        <P CLASS="table">In October '99 the 2D tilt mazes were the subject
        of further major rework. Many more mazes added (various sizes)
        and a range of brand new <B>multi-goal</B> mazes were added.
        The Java diverged here for this development (unfortunately) but
        perhaps one day I'll bring it all back together again.</P>

        The tilt puzzles take the tilt behaviour one step further and
        turn the basic 2D tilt maze into something more of a novelty.
        Two sliding blocks now share the same tray and must reach their
        own separate goals without coming into contact. Superficially
        the puzzles are just two mini mazes in one, the challenge however
        is the synchronisation.</P>

        <P CLASS="table">The tilt puzzle Java could have been a simple
        variation on what had come before, but the desire to implement
        a realistic slide effect forced me to dabble with something new...
        <B>Java threads</B>. Then, inevitably, my one small runnable
        class not so much slid but snowballed into a major overhaul of
        all the tilt maze source. The tilt puzzles now provide the base
        classes from which the tilt maze classes are derived. For an
        OO-impaired software engineer this turned out to be quite a voyage
        of discovery.</P>

        <P CLASS="table">The Java here was nothing new (I shrug off yet
        again the pressure to leap to Java 2) and thus took only a few
        hours to implement. The mazes however took a fair bit longer
        to devise and, even so, turned out limited in complexity. It
        has to be said, these are some of the strangest mazes I have
        ever had the pleasure to experiment with. Finding larger layouts,
        with longer solutions, remains a major challenge.</P>

        The marble tilt mazes are my latest foray into the tilt-maze
        concept. This is the code I should have written for the original
        tilt puzzles (March '98) but found a little beyond me at the
        time. Hence the original 'bang' effect as the blocks slid into
        each other (which was more or less what my code did, the first
        time I ran it). Now, some years later, and with a good deal more
        practice at thread and vector handling behind me, things seemed
        to have come together with slightly less explosive results.</P>

        </B>The hysteresis mazes are an interesting new type of puzzle-maze,

        Oskar kindly invited me to try implementing his puzzle in Java,
        and this worked very well indeed, although somehow the resulting
        mazes turned out not quite devious enough for either of us. So
        we increased the size, threw in a black hole or two, and finally
        sprinkled everything with strange yellow dots. Consider the yellow
        dots 'portals' into a strange inner dimension; the curious north&#150;south
        maze, that lurks behind every east&#150;west maze.</P>

        hey, we should all be experts. However it turns out this 'game'
        is about as unpredictable and uncontrollable as life itself.
        Basic survival is soon mastered, but are you a true master of
        your fate? Can you reach that ultimate goal? Fortunately in this

        preloading of size, start state and move sequence. In Jan 2002

        Two more exotic variations on the tilt theme, made possible by
        a multi-purpose applet developed by Graham which supports just
        about all forms of tilt puzzles so far, and a few other things
        yet to be invented, so this list will probably grow and grow.

        inspired by <B><A HREF="http://www.denki.co.uk/">Denki Blocks</A></B>.
        Denki does not itself use the tilt rule, but adding it allowed
        me to create some really tiny, meany puzzles. Try them and see,
        or try something less mind-blowing...<BR>

        At last some new java all of my own. A sort of evolution of Graham's
        'magblock' code, but with all the standard stuff separated off
        into its own class (puzzlePresenter) to enable rapid development
        of new puzzles. The clever bit is puzzlePresenter dynamically
        loads a second puzzle-specific class ('boxup' in this case) which
        must implement the stdpuzz interface. Took a little while to
        manage all the funny looking exceptions that can occur if things

        OK, I'm on a roll now. Actually it can't be a roll - I've done
        that already, so it must a wriggle. My puzzlePresenter classes
        are making this all very easy now, but I've added lots of interfaces
        to allow optional elements of game play. This one required the
        introduction of a interface to handle mouse motion.</P>

        Another Oskar creation reworked and extended out of almost all
        recognition for the web. Initially implemented using some basic
        trig functions, but which later proved superfluous. The biggest
        hurdle was implementing my own version of the Line2D.intersects()
        method. Not so much referencing the JAVA text-books here, it
        was more back to my O-level maths notes.</P>

        the algorithm such that the search for a new puzzle had an acceptably
        low number of solutions, yet didn't take for-ever to find them.
        Then there was the need to revisit java Threads, the first time
        for a while. Thanks to the auto-generation feature this is the
        first of my creations that you can play endlessly, I should really
