          Step over the lines in the correct colour sequence, that's all there is to it.
          Various micro-collections of mazes are currently accessible below, all 
          freshly implemented in puzzlescript (2021 onwards).

          <p><b>Update October 2023</b>: 
            Brad Klee sent me his Wolfram analysis of one of my red-white-blue 
            step-over mazes.
            His <a href=https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/2977383>write-up</a> 
            digs deep into how to measure the potential complexity of such mazes  
            and includes a comprehensive search for the best possible grid layouts on 
            the 3x3 and 4x4 grid. The resulting two mazes are playable

          <p>The first prototype (red-white-blue) maze, in action
            at Moulsford village green at one of our local village parties
            (June 2005).</p>
            <p>The maze was inspired by the purchase of a cheap ribbon 'door'
            made of lightweight plastic strips. It was cut to pieces and
            stapled together again in an afternoon, and only survived a couple
            of outings.</p>

            The second prototype (red-blue-yellow) at final manufacturing
            stage (Oct 2005). This version is far more durable being made
            of heavy-duty polypropylene webbing, riveted together.</p>
            <p>Four of these webbing mazes (two 4x4 designs and two 5x5 designs)
            were built for the <i>Techniek Museum Delft</i>, for use during
            their national Science Day in October 2006.
