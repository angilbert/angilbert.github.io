        <h2>Oskar's tunable maze</h2><p>
          Imagine you are lost in a complex maze. Wouldn't it be
          nice to have a simplified overview to get an idea where you are
          going? Oskar van Deventer's <i>Tunable Maze</i> offers you
          just this possibility. This maze is based on a fractal called
          the Dragons Curve. You can change the level of the maze 
          <i>while</i> you are solving it to experience the full effect of
          the fractal design.

        The goal is to manouvre the red dot from the bottom row to the 
        right-most column. The
        controls enable you to increase or reduce the difficulty level
        of the maze. The applet keeps
        track of the play level and you can peek at other levels without
        penalty. However if you make a move at a lower level the applet
        changes the play level to that level. You can only reset
        the play level by going all the way back to the start. </p>

          On the right is a photo from Oskar
          showing a Fractal Maze corresponding with one of the levels of
          the Tunable Maze. It is a dexterity puzzle containing a small
          ball-bearing. </p>
