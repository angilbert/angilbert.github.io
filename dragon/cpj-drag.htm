        <h2>Oskar's tunable maze</h2><p>
          Imagine you are lost in a complex maze. Wouldn't it be
          nice to have a simplified overview to get an idea where you are
          going? Oskar van Deventer's <i>Tunable Maze</i> offers you
          just this possibility. This maze is based on a fractal called
          the Dragons Curve. You can change the level of the maze 
          <i>while</i> you are solving it to experience the full effect of
          the fractal design.

        The goal is to manouvre the red dot from the bottom row to the 
        right-most column. The
        controls enable you to increase or reduce the difficulty level
        of the maze. The applet keeps
        track of the play level and you can peek at other levels without
        penalty. However if you make a move at a lower level the applet
        changes the play level to that level. You can only reset
        the play level by going all the way back to the start. </p>

        Below is second way to explore the tunable maze. Drag the
        layers of graphics (lattice-work) one at a time from left to
        right, and watch the maze develop. Each layer doubles the complexity
        of the maze and keeps on going until you run out of pixels.
        The white areas of each layer are transparent allowing underlying
        colours to show through. The maze (yellow pathway) is evident
        from about level four onwards. Enter the maze at the bottom (A)
        and exit to the right (B).</p>
