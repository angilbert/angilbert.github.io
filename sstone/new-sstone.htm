        <h2>The stepping-stone mazes</h2><p>
          Can you count to three? That's all you really need 
          for these nifty mazes. Step, step, step, change colour, repeat. 
          Each visit to each group of coloured stones must involve exactly 
          three steps, no more no less. These mazes were designed during 2011 
          in collaboration with Robert Abbott 
          (<a href="http://www.logicmazes.com">www.logicmazes.com</a>).

            These mazes were designed an atypical way. By following 
            a few basic ground rules (regarding the shape and size of the colour 
            groups) it turns out that a remarkable number of grid arrangements 
            naturally yield good mazes, requiring little or no refinement. 
          </p><p>
            A key underlying reason for such a high yield is the relative ease 
            of arranging the grid such that the resulting state-diagram is fully 
            connected (all states are both reachable and escapable) despite 
            also being a directed graph (where moves are non-reversible). This 
            type of state-diagram is technically known as a 
            <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/StronglyConnectedDigraph.html">
            strongly connected digraph</a> which, perhaps not surprisingly, 
            turns out to yield some very nice mazes.
