    Oskar's Four-bit mazes</H2>

    <P><B>Welcome to the Four-bit mazes by M. Oskar van Deventer.
    All these mazes use just four binary bits to create a sixteen-state
    maze, yet some mazes are very easy and some very difficult depending
    on what <I>rule</I> was used during maze construction. Oskar
    designed many four-bit mazes using different rules, and nine
    of these mazes are offered in interactive form below.</B></P>

    <P>Details of all rules are listed at the bottom of this page,
    but can you work out each rule without seeing it? And does actually
    knowing the rule make the challenge any easier? (the name of
    each maze may give you a hint). The Four-bit mazes are closely
    related to my early <B><A HREF="t00.htm">HTML maze</A></B> (dropped
    March 2000, and now re-instated).</P>

        <P>Oskar's original puzzle is electro-mechanical and is driven
        by a micro-controller. The aim is to press down all the switches.
        The micro-controller can both pull down and push up switches
        using springs and four electromagnets. A photo is shown here
        on the right.</P>

        <P>In the applet version the challenge is to switch off four
        lights. Click below and then select your puzzle from the menu
        marked <I>Mazes</I>.</P>

    <H2>The Rules</H2>

    <P><B>All OK:</B> is a training challenge. You can always push
    any button, which just clicks the associated light on and off.<BR>
    <B>Wrong move reset:</B> is a simple four-move challenge. But
    one wrong move and you go back to the start.<BR>
    <B>PIN code:</B> also has a four-move solution, but this time
    you do not get immediate feedback that you went down the wrong
    path. The maze forks like a tree, and just one &quot;leaf&quot;
    is the exit.<BR>
    <B>Memory:</B> is a real memory test, requiring fifteen moves
    to solve, passing through all states. Again, one wrong move and
    you go back to the start.<BR>
    <B>Deeper &amp; deeper:</B> is a <I>progressive</I> maze. As
    you switch a light off a maximum of one light will come back
    on giving you a feeling of progress through the maze. <BR>
    <B>Four-Bit maze:</B> is a <I>non-progressive</I> maze. More
    than one light may come back on in this maze so it's harder to
    tell how well you're doing.<BR>
    <B>No sense:</B> is even less progressive than <I>Four-Bit</I>,
    the change of lights is totally unrelated to the button that
    you push.<BR>
    <B>Karnaugh:</B> is like walking through a Karnaugh diagram.
    As in <I>All OK</I> each button only affects its own light, and
    you can turn lights both off and on, but this time not all buttons
    will be enabled. <BR>
    <B>One way: </B>is similar to <I>Karnaugh</I>. However once you
    have moved forward by pushing a button, the button will always
    be left disabled so you cannot simply reverse you last move to
    try different options.</P>
