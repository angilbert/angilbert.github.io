        <h2>XL-up maze</h2><p>
          Way back in 2005 I turned the grand old age of 40 and designed
          a maze to mark the passing of the years. Starting from the
          central square, step out the roman number sequence from I to
          XL (1 to 40), starting I, II, III, IV etc. The roman-numeral
          sequence doesn't stop at 40 however, so as a secondary challenge
          why not see how much further you can go... 50? 60? 70?
        </p>
      </div>

      <div><p>
        The goal is to step out the roman numeral sequence from I to XL (1 to 40). 
        So that's I,II,III,IV,V... and so on, punctuated correctly with blank spaces. 
        Hint: keep an eye on the rolling ticker-tape underneath the grid if 
        you can't remember how to count in roman numerals.

        <p>The original applet is no longer available, but the mazes are still 
          accessible thanks to zaratustra at itch.io...

        <h4>Footnotes</h4><p>
        Back in 2005 I asked the question... is it possible to construct an 
        alternative 7x7 grid where the sequence can run even deeper? 
        In September 2006 Ben Small did just this and found a maze that runs 
        even deeper than my original maze. Ben's grid has thus been added 
        as a second challenge.
