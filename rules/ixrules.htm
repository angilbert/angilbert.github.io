    </TABLE><B>This page introduces a range of related puzzles based
    on arrays of <I>operators</I>. Each operator enforces a simple,
    logical motion through an array cell, and onward into an adjacent
    cell. Each cell contains a maximum of one operator selected from
    a small, pre-defined set. The combined effect across the breadth
    of the array is often a complex interwoven network of pathways,
    ordered in one sense yet chaotic in another. Just the sort of
    behaviour that lends itself to some interesting puzzles and mazes.</B></P>

    <P>This page explores a variety of different operator sets and
    introduces a number of hitherto unpublished mazes and puzzles:</P>

    <P>The NEWS maze is based on a grid of <B>absolute</B> directional
    operators (<B>N</B>/<B>E</B>/<B>W</B>/<B>S</B>), along with <B>+</B>
    that indicates a junction point, and <B><I>blank</I></B> that
    acts as a bridge. This combination of operators allows for some
    note-worthy mazes, here follows an example. Try far left to far
    right to begin with, and then try the reverse.</P>

    <P><CENTER><IMG SRC="grid1.gif" WIDTH="484" HEIGHT="220" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
    BORDER="0" ></CENTER></P>

    <P>This maze has been carefully designed to offer two distinct
    yet equally difficult challenges, one in each direction. More
    often than not the reverse route will be either trivial or impossible,
    but this <B>non-reversability</B> (or <B>implicit arrow</B>)
    is a common feature of many puzzle-mazes, and certainly all puzzles
    on this page. Note that due to the absolute nature of the NEWS
    operators it would be quite possible to present NEWS using arrows
    instead of letters.</P>

    <P>It is also worth noting that, without <B><I>blank</I></B>,
    NEWS would be significantly less complex since it would not be
    possible for paths to cross under and over each other. NEWS is
    the only operator set that relies entirely on <B><I>blank</I></B>
    for bridging but, that said, <B><I>blank</I></B> (or equivalent)
    will often still be present. A simple bridge is one of those
    fundamental maze building blocks that it is difficult to live
    without.</P>

    <P>RULES is much like NEWS, but based on the set of <B>relative</B>
    rather than absolute operators. If you think about it <B>R</B>,
    <B>U</B>, <B>L</B> and <B>S</B> (relative) are the natural equivalents
    of <B>N</B>, <B>E</B>, <B>W</B> and <B>S</B> (absolute). The
    <B>S</B> (in RULES) however is also equivalent to <B><I>blank</I></B>
    (in NEWS) so we automatically drop the need for one operator.
    <B>+</B> is retained as a four-way junction point. Here is an
    example:</P>

    <P><CENTER><IMG SRC="grid2.gif" WIDTH="172" HEIGHT="124" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
    BORDER="0" ></CENTER></P>

    <P>Note that in these mazes I make no attempt to eliminate the
    false exits around the perimeter of the grid, so it is quite
    possible to drop out of the maze at the wrong place. A dead-end
    of this sort is often called a <B>black hole</B> since the implicit
    arrow prevents you simply turning around and retracing your steps.
    With RULES, unlike NEWS, it seems a tad difficult to construct
    a maze with no false exits. A complete outer ring of <B>L</B>,
    <B>R</B> or <B>U</B> operators (with one <B>S</B> to allow entry/exit)
    would suffice, but is not particularly pleasing. I leave it as
    a challenge for the reader to construct a RULES maze (or simple
    RULS grid) with only one perimeter entry/exit point. Note that
    it is also possible to construct mazes with internal black holes
    (typically a loop with one or more entrance points, but no exit).
    The RULES mazes here have no internal black holes but the earlier
    NEWS maze did contain a small internal black hole, did you spot
    it?</P>

    <P>Here is a slightly larger maze that illustrates RULES in full
    glory. In this maze you will have to visit some cells up to three
    times. The <B>U</B> operator is also used here, which is missing
    from the smaller example above.</P>

    <P>Multi-RULES is an extension of RULES that doubles up the meaning
    of each operator, turning each cell into a potential junction
    point (and dropping the need for <B>+</B>). The connectivity
    between cells gets a little unmanageable at this stage so <B>U</B>
    has been dropped completely (U-turns are never permitted) and
    <I>blank</I> (straight only) has been reinstated.</P>

    <P>One of the aims of multi-RULES was to find an operator set
    that was 100% multi-state. NEWS is approx 20% multi-state and
    RULES 80% (by cell count) but significantly the decision points
    in both NEWS and RULES are always single-state. Multi-RULES,
    in contrast, is fully multi-state. This multi-RULES operator
    set is the smallest yet, but is also the most powerful. It turns
    out there is little need to use all the operators, all at the
    same time. Here is a maze based on just <B>T</B> and <B><I>blank</I></B>.
    It is a smaller example of my <B>Left and right only </B>maze
    (found in the gallery).</P>

    <P><CENTER><IMG SRC="grid4.gif" WIDTH="191" HEIGHT="165" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
    BORDER="0" ></CENTER></P>

    <P>And just to prove it is possible, here is a maze created entirely
    of <B>R</B>, <B>L</B> and <B>T</B> operators. If helpful, think
    of <B>R</B> as 'may go right' and <B>L</B> as 'may go left'.
    In this maze you always have two choices, so being forced out
    of the maze by accident is relatively easy to avoid, but beware,
    it can still happen. Oh, and beware of the central black hole.</P>

    <H2><A NAME="colour"></A><HR ALIGN=LEFT>Colour-box puzzles</H2>

    <P>This puzzle returns to the traditional set of RULES operators
    but drops the <B>+</B> (junction) operator and thus moves away
    from the concept of a pure maze.</P>

    <P>The best introduction to the colour-box puzzles is to try
    constructing your own. Take a 4 &times; 4 grid and fill it randomly
    with <B>RULS</B> operators, then trace through every possible
    pathway (sixteen in total). You will find that none of the paths
    converge, each exit point is used just once, and every cell is
    used exactly four times (unless you happen to have some internal
    black-holes). Most of the paths will be short but one or two
    will probably turn out extra long and twisty. Now, to create
    the puzzle simply take your <B>RULS</B> grid and redraw it using
    colours instead of letters. Finally mark in one or two entry/exit
    points, from your original sketch, and challenge someone to work
    out which colour maps to which operator.</P>

    <P>Here is an example colour-box puzzle with a single, unique
    solution. This is the hardest of four puzzles that appeared on
    my <B>Gathering For Gardner IV</B> (<B><A HREF="http://www.g4g4.com/">G4G4</A></B>)
    exchange handout. If this example proves rather tricky for starters,
    see my <B><A HREF="_g4g4.htm">full handout</A></B>.</P>

    <P><CENTER><IMG SRC="colour1.gif" WIDTH="148" HEIGHT="100" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
    BORDER="0" ></CENTER></P>

    <P>These puzzles are limited by the fact there are basically
    only 24 operator/key permutations to think about and process
    of elimination exhausts the options quite quickly. To increase
    the number of permutations (from 24 to 256) it was suggested
    I could simply drop the one-to-one relationship between operator
    and key. Some operators may be used more than once, some not
    at all. Here is one example of a 256-permutation colour-box puzzle.
    One trivial solution to this puzzle is <B>red = yellow = blue
    = green = S</B>, but can you find the <B>one and only </B>alternative
    solution?</P>

    <P>The <B><A HREF="http://www.henleymob.co.uk/Lattice/Lattice.html">lattice
    puzzles</A></B> are a mind-boggling extension of the colour-box
    puzzles. Devised, developed and presented in applet form by Graham,
    at his home site. These puzzles will test your spatial awareness,
    as well as your powers of logical deduction. Graham replaced
    my 2D (4x4) <B>grid</B> with a 3D (3x3x3) <B>lattice</B> and
    selected seven of the available operators. Note that using three
    dimensions allows for a much broader range of operators; this
    increases the number of key/operator permutations and allows
    the one-to-one relationship to be retained.</P>

    <P>The seven (relative) operators are listed above. Note that
    <B>Anti</B> and <B>Clock</B> are <I>roll</I> operations that
    rotate you ninety degrees. They do not affect your direction,
    only your orientation (<B>Null</B> affects neither direction
    nor orientation). I find it helpful to imagine myself in a fighter
    plane, or spaceship, flying through a network of tunnels. Click
