        <h2>NEWS and RULES</h2><p>
          This page introduces a range of related puzzles based
          on arrays of <i>operators</i>. Each operator enforces a simple,
          logical motion through an array cell, and onward into an adjacent
          cell. Each cell contains a maximum of one operator selected from
          a small, pre-defined set. The combined effect across the breadth
          of the array is often a complex interwoven network of pathways,
          ordered in one sense yet chaotic in another. Just the sort of
          behaviour that lends itself to some interesting puzzles and mazes.

        <h2>NEWS maze</h2>
        <p>The NEWS maze is based on a grid of <b>absolute</b> directional
        operators (<b>N</b>/<b>E</b>/<b>W</b>/<b>S</b>), along with <b>+</b>
        that indicates a junction point, and <b><i>blank</i></b> that
        acts as a bridge. This combination of operators allows for some
        note-worthy mazes, here follows an example. Try far left to far
        right to begin with, and then try the reverse.</p>

        <div class="table-block">
          <p><img src="grid1.gif" width="484"></p>
          <table class="rules-table">
              <tr><th colspan="2">Operators</th></tr>
              <tr><td>N</td><td>North only</td></tr>
              <tr><td>E</td><td>East only</td></tr>
              <tr><td>W</td><td>West only</td></tr>
              <tr><td>S</td><td>South only</td></tr>
              <tr><td>+</td><td>Everyway (NEWS)</td></tr>
              <tr><td>blank</td><td>Straight only</td></tr>
            </table>
        </div>
        <p>This maze has been carefully designed to offer two distinct
        yet equally difficult challenges, one in each direction. More
        often than not the reverse route will be either trivial or impossible,
        but this <b>non-reversability</b> (or <b>implicit arrow</b>)
        is a common feature of many puzzle-mazes, and certainly all puzzles
        on this page. Note that due to the absolute nature of the NEWS
        operators it would be quite possible to present NEWS using arrows
        instead of letters.</p>
        <p>It is also worth noting that, without <b><i>blank</i></b>,
        NEWS would be significantly less complex since it would not be
        possible for paths to cross under and over each other. NEWS is
        the only operator set that relies entirely on <b><i>blank</i></b>
        for bridging but, that said, <b><i>blank</i></b> (or equivalent)
        will often still be present. A simple bridge is one of those
        fundamental maze building blocks that it is difficult to live
        without.</p>

        <h2>RULES maze</h2>
        <p>RULES is much like NEWS, but based on the set of <b>relative</b>
          rather than absolute operators. If you think about it <b>R</b>,
          <b>U</b>, <b>L</b> and <b>S</b> (relative) are the natural equivalents
          of <b>N</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>W</b> and <b>S</b> (absolute). The
          <b>S</b> (in RULES) however is also equivalent to <b><i>blank</i></b>
          (in NEWS) so we automatically drop the need for one operator.
          <b>+</b> is retained as a four-way junction point. 
          Here is a small example:</p> 
          <div class="table-block">
              <p><img src="grid2.gif" width="172"></p>
              <table class="rules-table">
                <tr><th colspan="2">Operators</th></tr>
                <tr><td>R</td><td>Right only</td></tr>
                <tr><td>U</td><td>U-turn only</td></tr>
                <tr><td>L</td><td>Left only</td></tr>
                <tr><td>+</td><td>Everyway (RULS)</td></tr>
                <tr><td>S</td><td>Straight only</td></tr>
              </table>
          </div>  
        <p>Note that in these mazes I make no attempt to eliminate the
          false exits around the perimeter of the grid, so it is quite
          possible to drop out of the maze at the wrong place. A dead-end
          of this sort is often called a <b>black hole</b> since the implicit
          arrow prevents you simply turning around and retracing your steps.
          With RULES, unlike NEWS, it seems a tad difficult to construct
          a maze with no false exits. A complete outer ring of <b>L</b>,
          <b>R</b> or <b>U</b> operators (with one <b>S</b> to allow entry/exit)
          would suffice, but is not particularly pleasing. I leave it as
          a challenge for the reader to construct a RULES maze (or simple
          RULS grid) with only one perimeter entry/exit point. Note that
          it is also possible to construct mazes with internal black holes
          (typically a loop with one or more entrance points, but no exit).
          The RULES mazes here have no internal black holes but the earlier
          NEWS maze did contain a small internal black hole, did you spot
          it?</p>
        <p>Here is a slightly larger maze that illustrates RULES in full
          glory. In this maze you will have to visit some cells up to three
          times. The <b>U</b> operator is also used here, which is missing
          from the smaller example above.</p>
          <div class="table-block">
              <p><img src="grid3.gif" width="220"></p>
              <table class="rules-table">
                <tr><th colspan="2">Operators</th></tr>
                <tr><td>R</td><td>Right only</td></tr>
                <tr><td>U</td><td>U-turn only</td></tr>
                <tr><td>L</td><td>Left only</td></tr>
                <tr><td>+</td><td>Everyway (RULS)</td></tr>
                <tr><td>S</td><td>Straight only</td></tr>
              </table>
          </div>

      <div>
        <a name="mrules"></a>
        <h2>Multi-RULES maze</h2>
        <p>Multi-RULES is an extension of RULES that doubles up the meaning
          of each operator, turning each cell into a potential junction
          point (and dropping the need for <b>+</b>). The connectivity
          between cells gets a little unmanageable at this stage so <b>U</b>
          has been dropped completely (U-turns are never permitted) and
          <i>blank</i> (straight only) has been reinstated.</p>
          <p>One of the aims of multi-RULES was to find an operator set
          that was 100% multi-state. NEWS is approx 20% multi-state and
          RULES 80% (by cell count) but significantly the decision points
          in both NEWS and RULES are always single-state. Multi-RULES,
          in contrast, is fully multi-state. This multi-RULES operator
          set is the smallest yet, but is also the most powerful. It turns
          out there is little need to use all the operators, all at the
          same time. Here is a maze based on just <b>T</b> and <b><i>blank</i></b>.
          It is a smaller example of my <b>Left and right only</b> maze
          (found in the gallery).</p>
          <div class="table-block">
              <p><img src="grid4.gif" width="191"></p>
              <table class="rules-table">
                <tr><th colspan="2">Operators</th></tr>
                <tr><td>R</td><td>Right or straight</td></tr>
                <tr><td>L</td><td>Left or straight</td></tr>
                <tr><td>T</td><td>T-junction (left or right)</td></tr>
                <tr><td>blank</td><td>Straight only</td></tr>
              </table>
          </div>  
          <p>
            And just to prove it is possible, here is a maze created entirely
            of <b>R</b>, <b>L</b> and <b>T</b> operators. If helpful, think
            of <b>R</b> as <i>may go right</i> and <b>L</b> as <i>may go left</i>.
            In this maze you always have two choices, so being forced out
            of the maze by accident is relatively easy to avoid, but beware,
            it can still happen. Oh, and beware of the central black hole.

          <h2>Colour-box puzzles</h2>
          <p>This puzzle returns to the traditional set of RULES operators
            but drops the <b>+</b> (junction) operator and thus moves away
            from the concept of a pure maze.</p>
            <p>The best introduction to the colour-box puzzles is to try
            constructing your own. Take a 4 &times; 4 grid and fill it randomly
            with <b>RULS</b> operators, then trace through every possible
            pathway (sixteen in total). You will find that none of the paths
            converge, each exit point is used just once, and every cell is
            used exactly four times (unless you happen to have some internal
            black-holes). Most of the paths will be short but one or two
            will probably turn out extra long and twisty. Now, to create
            the puzzle simply take your <b>RULS</b> grid and redraw it using
            colours instead of letters. Finally mark in one or two entry/exit
            points, from your original sketch, and challenge someone to work
            out which colour maps to which operator.</p>
          <p>Here is an example colour-box puzzle with a single, unique
            solution. This is the hardest of four puzzles that appeared on
            my <b>Gathering For Gardner IV</b> exchange handout. 
            <!--If this example proves rather tricky for starters,
            see my <a href="new-g4g4.htm">full handout</a>.-->
          </p>
          <div class="table-block">
              <p><img src="colour1.gif" width="148"></p>
          </div>  
          <p>These puzzles are limited by the fact there are basically
            only 24 operator/key permutations to think about and process
            of elimination exhausts the options quite quickly. To increase
            the number of permutations (from 24 to 256) it was suggested
            I could simply drop the one-to-one relationship between operator
            and key. Some operators may be used more than once, some not
            at all. Here is one example of a 256-permutation colour-box puzzle.
            One trivial solution to this puzzle is <b>red = yellow = blue
            = green = S</b>, but can you find the 
            <b>one and only</b> alternative solution?</p>

          <h2>Lattice puzzles</h2>
          <p>The <a href="http://www.henleymob.co.uk/Lattice/Lattice.html">lattice
            puzzles</a> are a mind-boggling extension of the colour-box
            puzzles. Devised, developed and presented in native applet form 
            by <a href="http://www.henleymob.co.uk/">Graham</a>.
            These puzzles will test your spatial awareness,
            as well as your powers of logical deduction. Graham replaced
            my 2D (4x4) <b>grid</b> with a 3D (3x3x3) <b>lattice</b> and
            selected seven of the available operators. Note that using three
            dimensions allows for a much broader range of operators; this
            increases the number of key/operator permutations and allows
            the one-to-one relationship to be retained.</p>

            <p>Note that <b>Anti</b> and <b>Clock</b> are <i>roll</i> operations 
            that rotate you ninety degrees. They do not affect your direction
            only your orientation (<b>Null</b> affects neither direction
            nor orientation). I find it helpful to imagine myself in a fighter
            plane, or spaceship, flying through a network of tunnels. Click
