        <h2>The quantum maze </h2><p>
          Welcome to the quantum maze! Where is the maze I hear you ask? Well, 
          still in its many quantum-states of course. As you explore the grid the 
          maze will collapse around you, and walls will materialise in positions dictated 
          by your chosen route (following a simple rule). Once the maze walls have 
          collapsed into existence, nothing will shift them. To try a different route 
          you have to reset the entire universe!

        <h3>Development notes</h3>
        <p>
          This puzzle was introduced to me by Jonathan Welton, during 
          one of the UK <i>Gathering for Gardner Celebration of Mind</i> Events 
          in October 2010. Jonathan had first explored this concept over two decades 
          ago, at which point he discovered the 8x8 grid had a single unique solution. 
          More recently I discovered the 5x5 grid was also solvable and Jonathan 
          went on to prove you can visit the blue corners in either order, left 
          then right or vice-versa (can you find both solutions?). Explore the quantum 
          maze below (5x5, 8x8, or the mystery bonus 12x6) and read more about its 
          history. Both Jonathan and I have struggled to classify this puzzle. Is 
          it actually a maze? It is certainly not a multi-state maze in the familiar 
          sense. So then what is it? It is of course, a <i>quantum-maze</i>!

        <h3>Background (Jonathan Welton)</h3>
        <p>I created this in the late 80s or early 90s. I posted it on 
          rec.puzzles around that time. The puzzle answers a question raised by 
          multi-state mazes where one can visit a location in more than one state, 
          such as in a <b><a href="../noleft/new-noleft.htm">no-left turn maze</a></b>. 
          When several states are possible the underlying maze can be simpler while 
          maintaining the same difficulty of solution, because the multiple states 
          make up for the lack of maze complexity.</p>
        <p>This raises the question of whether a maze could require less information 
          to describe it than it takes to describe the solution. Some rolling block 
          mazes arguably achieve this feat, for example Richard Tucker's <b>
          <a href="http://www.logicmazes.com/rb/column.html">Rolling-Megalith 
          Maze</a></b> where the underlying maze consists of only three blocks. 
          </p>
        <p>But this maze answers the question absolutely, as the solution requires 
          a long path to be described, with the maze objective describable in just 
          a few bits, and the underlying maze itself empty and requiring no information 
          at all to describe it. It could be argued that an empty grid can't be 
          a maze at all, by the definition of a maze. And yet, as you wander through 
          the puzzle it undoubtedly feels like a maze, one which is being slowly 
          revealed to you as to progress through it. So there we have it: 
          a maze which definitively requires less information to describe it than 
          to describe the solution.</p>
