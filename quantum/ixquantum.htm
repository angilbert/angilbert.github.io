      <B>Welcome to the quantum maze! Where is the maze I hear you ask? Well, 
      still in its many quantum-states of course. As you explore the grid the 
      maze will collapse around you, and walls will materialise in positions dictated 
      by your chosen route (following a simple rule). Once the maze walls have 
      collapsed into existence, nothing will shift them. To try a different route 
      you have to reset the entire universe! </B> 
      <p align="left">This puzzle was introduced to me by Jonathan Welton, during 
        one of the UK <i>Gathering for Gardner Celebration of Mind </i>Events 
        in October 2010. Jonathan had first explored this concept over two decades 
        ago, at which point he discovered the 8x8 grid had a single unique solution. 
        More recently I discovered the 5x5 grid was also solvable and Jonathan 
        went on to prove you can visit the blue corners in either order, left 
        then right or vice-versa (can you find both solutions?). Explore the quantum 
        maze below (5x5, 8x8, or the mystery bonus 12x6) and read more about its 
        history. Both Jonathan and I have struggled to classify this puzzle. Is 
        it actually a maze? It is certainly not a multi-state maze in the familiar 
        sense. So then what is it? It is of course, a <i>quantum-maze</i>!</p>

      <h3>Background (Jonathan Welton)</h3>
      <p><i>&quot;I created this in the late 80s or early 90s. I posted it on 
        rec.puzzles around that time. The puzzle answers a question raised by 
        multi-state mazes where one can visit a location in more than one state, 
        such as in a <b><a href="../noleft/ixnoleft.htm">no-left turn maze</a></b>. 
        When several states are possible the underlying maze can be simpler while 
        maintaining the same difficulty of solution, because the multiple states 
        make up for the lack of maze complexity.</i></p>
      <p><i>This raises the question of whether a maze could require less information 
        to describe it than it takes to describe the solution. Some rolling block 
        mazes arguably achieve this feat, for example Richard Tucker's <b><a href="http://www.logicmazes.com/rb/column.html">Rolling-Megalith 
        Maze</a></b> where the underlying maze consists of only three blocks. 
        </i></p>
      <p><i>But this maze answers the question absolutely, as the solution requires 
        a long path to be described, with the maze objective describable in just 
        a few bits, and the underlying maze itself empty and requiring no information 
        at all to describe it. It could be argued that an empty grid can't be 
        a maze at all, by the definition of a maze. And yet, as you wander through 
        the puzzle it undoubtedly feels like a maze, one which is being slowly 
        revealed to you as to progress through it. </i><i>So there we have it: 
        a maze which definitively requires less information to describe it than 
        to describe the solution.&quot;</i></p>
