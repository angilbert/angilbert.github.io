        <h2>Knotwork</h2><p>
          A knotty deductive puzzle inspired by the ancient art-form of celtic knotwork. 
          The goal is to finish the knot, by joining all the dots, to form a single 
          continuous loop. 
        </p>

      <div><p>
        As you will soon discover... you can only explore a limited 
        section of the knotwork, starting from the top-left corner. As you connect more 
        dots you will be able to explore deeper into the design but you will still only
        have access to the two ends of the path you've explored so far. 
        This might seem a little restrictive, but I guarantee you can logically deduce the 
        whole design without resorting to pencil-and-paper.</p>
