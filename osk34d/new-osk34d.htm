        <h2>Oskar's four dimensional maze</h2><p>
          Consider this ... what would a four-dimensional maze look 
          like if prototyped as a three-dimensional mechanical puzzle or 
          rendered as a two-dimensional virtual puzzle?
          Well, here is the answer.
          Can you navigate the four-dimensional runner to its 
          four-dimensional goal? 
        </p>

          The four red runners must reach the blue targets. Notice that the
          four runners are coupled and always form a rectangle. A move
          is only possible if the coupled runners can move simultaneously.
          Learn the operation by first playing the 'trainer' challenge
          a few times.

          <p>The photo on the right shows a mechanical realisation of Oskar's
            4D Maze. The red disc contains two mazes, there is a second disc
            on the reverse that contains another two mazes. The 'runners'
            are the clear spheres, there are two more on the reverse. The
            runners are locked in pairs (back and front) and also locked
            to the green and yellow semi-circles which can be slid apart
            in a controlled manner to effect the <i>always form a rectangle</i>
            rule. The photo here illustrates the start position, the goal
            is to solve all four mazes simultaneously so the puzzle comes
            to pieces.</p>
            <p>The illustrated puzzle is an implementation of maze '4x4x4x4'
            (see applet) but translated into three-dimensions as opposed
            to four. Puzzle design is by Oskar and manufacture is by George
            Miller.</p>
