        <h2>Oskar's Belgian Maze</h2><p>
          A Belgian maze is a maze without any loops or forks. Maze experts
          call such maze a labyrinth. Mathematicians call it unicursal.
          English might call it Irish. 
          Would you think that you never could get lost in a Belgian Maze? 
          Think again!

          This challenge by Oskar van Deventer shows that even
          Belgian mazes can be hard to solve. The trick is to keep track of 
          what are the forward and backward directions. When you get confused 
          you may inadvertently start moving backward until you discover your
          error, or until you get confused again.

          <h4>Aim</h4><p>
            Move from the blue start to the red goal. At every green &quot;confusion
            point&quot; you will be spun around a multiple of 180 degrees. The number
            of 180 degree rotations is deterministic (nothing random in this puzzle),
            but you do not know whether it is an even number or an odd number. And the
            number is different for every confusion point.

      The Belgian Maze puzzle is related to the
      mechanical Mysterians puzzle by Oskar van Deventer. Mysterians is a puzzle
      of three-layers. Each layer has a single curved groove. The three layers
      interact with each other through two pivots. The object is to take it
      apart. Even though the problem has no loops or forks, it is quite
      confusing as the pivots run forward and backward through the grooves. At
      many points moving forward feels like moving backward, so you are inclined
      to turn around.</p>
